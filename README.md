# Lightweight Machine Learning Classics with R
# (Draft v0.2x of *Machine Learning in R from Scratch*)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3820167.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3820167)


Explore some of the most fundamental algorithms which have stood the test of time and provide the basis for innovative solutions in data-driven AI. Learn how to use the R language for implementing various stages of data processing and modelling activities. Appreciate mathematics as the universal language for formalising data-intense problems and communicating their solutions. The book is for you if you're yet to be fluent with university-level linear algebra, calculus and probability theory or you've forgotten all the maths you've ever learned, and are seeking a gentle, albeit thorough, introduction to the topic.

> This is a slightly older (distributed in the hope that it will be useful)
version of the forthcoming textbook (ETA 2022)
preliminarily entitled *Machine Learning in R from Scratch*
by [Marek Gagolewski][1], which is now undergoing a major revision
(when I am not busy with other projects). There will be not much work on-going
in this repository anymore, as its sources have moved elsewhere;
however, if you happen to find any bugs or typos, please drop me an
[email][5]. I will share a new draft once it's ripe. Stay tuned.

## About the Author

[Marek Gagolewski][1] (pronounced like Mark Gaggle-Eve-Ski 🙃)
is currently a Senior Lecturer in Applied
AI at Deakin University in Melbourne, VIC, Australia
and an Associate Professor in Data Science (on long-term leave)
at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University
of Technology, Poland.

He is actively involved in developing *usable* free (libre) and open source
software, with particular focus on data science and machine learning.
He is the main author and maintainer of [stringi][4] – one of the most often
downloaded R packages (with over 33,000,000 downloads) that aims at natural
language and string processing as well as the Python and R package
[genieclust][3] implementing the fast and robust hierarchical clustering
algorithm *Genie* with noise point detection.

He's an author of more than 75 publications on machine learning and
optimisation algorithms, data aggregation and clustering, statistical
modelling, and scientific computing. Moreover, Marek taught various courses
related to R and Python programming, algorithms, data science,
and machine learning in Australia, Poland, and Germany
(e.g., at [Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com)).
