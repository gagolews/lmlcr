You can access this book at: https://lmlcr.gagolewski.com/ (a browser-friendly version) https://lmlcr.gagolewski.com/lmlcr.pdf (PDF) https://github.com/gagolews/lmlcr (source code) Aims and Scope Machine learning has numerous exciting real-world applications, including stock market prediction, speech recognition, computer-aided medical diagnosis, content and product recommendation, anomaly detection in security camera footage, game playing, autonomous vehicle operation, and many others. In this book we will take an unpretentious glance at the most fundamental algorithms that have stood the test of time and which form the basis for state-of-the-art solutions of modern AI, which is principally (big) data-driven. We will learn how to use the R language (R Development Core Team 2021) for implementing various stages of data processing and modelling activities. For a more in-depth treatment of R, refer to this book’s Appendices and, for instance, (Wickham &amp; Grolemund 2017, Peng 2019, Venables et al. 2021). These pages contain solid underpinnings for further studies related to statistical learning, machine learning data science, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, including (Bishop 2006, Hastie et al. 2017, James et al. 2017). We will also appreciate the vital role of mathematics as a universal language for formalising data-intense problems and communicating their solutions. The book is aimed at readers who are yet to be fluent with university-level linear algebra, calculus and probability theory, such as 1st year undergrads or those who have forgotten all the maths they have learned and need a gentle, non-invasive, yet rigorous introduction to the topic. For a nice, machine learning-focused introduction to mathematics alone, see, e.g., (Deisenroth et al. 2020). About the Author Marek Gagolewski (pronounced like Mark Gaggle-Eve-Ski) is currently a Senior Lecturer in Applied AI at Deakin University in Melbourne, VIC, Australia and an Associate Professor in Data Science (on long-term leave) at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland. He is actively involved in developing usable free (libre) and open source software, with particular focus on data science and machine learning. He is the main author and maintainer of stringi – one of the most often downloaded R packages (with over 33,000,000 downloads) that aims at natural language and string processing as well as the Python and R package genieclust implementing the fast and robust hierarchical clustering algorithm Genie with noise point detection. He’s an author of more than 75 publications on machine learning and optimisation algorithms, data aggregation and clustering, statistical modelling, and scientific computing. Explaining of things matters to him more than merely tuning the knobs so as to increase a chosen performance metric (with uncontrollable consequences to other ones); the latter belongs to technology and wizardry, not science. Moreover, Marek taught various courses related to R and Python programming, algorithms, data science, and machine learning in Australia, Poland, and Germany (e.g., at Data Science Retreat).

An algorithm is a well-defined sequence of instructions that, for a given sequence of input arguments, yields some desired output. In other words, it is a specific recipe for a function. Developing algorithms is a tedious task. In machine learning, we build and study computer algorithms that make predictions or decisions but which are not manually programmed. Learning needs some material based upon which new knowledge is to be acquired. In other words, we need data. 1.1.2 Main Types of Machine Learning Problems Machine Learning Problems include, but are not limited to: Supervised learning – for every input point (e.g., a photo) there is an associated desired output (e.g., whether it depicts a crosswalk or how many cars can be seen on it) Unsupervised learning – inputs are unlabelled, the aim is to discover the underlying structure in the data (e.g., automatically group customers w.r.t. common behavioural patterns) Semi-supervised learning – some inputs are labelled, the others are not (definitely a cheaper scenario) Reinforcement learning – learn to act based on a feedback given after the actual decision was made (e.g., learn to play The Witcher 7 by testing different hypotheses what to do to survive as long as possible) 1.2 Supervised Learning 1.2.1 Formalism Let \\(\\mathbf{X}=\\{\\mathfrak{X}_1,\\dots,\\mathfrak{X}_n\\}\\) be an input sample (“a database”) that consists of \\(n\\) objects. Most often we assume that each object \\(\\mathfrak{X}_i\\) is represented using \\(p\\) numbers for some \\(p\\). We denote this fact as \\(\\mathfrak{X}_i\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) (it is a \\(p\\)-dimensional real vector or a sequence of \\(p\\) numbers or a point in a \\(p\\)-dimensional real space or an element of a real \\(p\\)-space etc.). If we have “complex” objects on input, we can always try representing them as feature vectors (e.g., come up with numeric attributes that best describe them in a task at hand). Exercise. Consider the following problems: How would you represent a patient in a clinic? How would you represent a car in an insurance company’s database? How would you represent a student in an university? Of course, our setting is abstract in the sense that there might be different realities hidden behind these symbols. This is what maths is for – creating abstractions or models of complex entities/phenomena so that they can be much more easily manipulated or understood. This is very powerful – spend a moment contemplating how many real-world situations fit into our framework. This also includes image/video data, e.g., a 1920×1080 pixel image can be “unwound” to a “flat” vector of length 2,073,600. (*) There are some algorithms such as Multidimensional Scaling, Locally Linear Embedding, IsoMap etc. that can do that automagically. In cases such as this we say that we deal with structured (tabular) data – \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) can be written as an (\\(n\\times p\\))-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{X}= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} \\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] Mathematically, we denote this as \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\). Remark. Structured data == think: Excel/Calc spreadsheets, SQL tables etc. For an example, consider the famous Fisher’s Iris flower dataset, see ?iris in R and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set. X &lt;- iris[1:6, 1:4] # first 6 rows and 4 columns X # or: print(X) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 dim(X) # gives n and p ## [1] 6 4 dim(iris) # for the full dataset ## [1] 150 5 \\(x_{i,j}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) represents the \\(j\\)-th feature of the \\(i\\)-th observation, \\(j=1,\\dots,p\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). For instance: X[3, 2] # 3rd row, 2nd column ## [1] 3.2 The third observation (data point, row in \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)) consists of items \\((x_{3,1}, \\dots, x_{3,p})\\) that can be extracted by calling: X[3,] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 as.numeric(X[3,]) # drops names ## [1] 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 length(X[3,]) ## [1] 4 Moreover, the second feature/variable/column is comprised of \\((x_{1,2}, x_{2,2}, \\dots, x_{n,2})\\): X[,2] ## [1] 3.5 3.0 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 length(X[,2]) ## [1] 6 We will sometimes use the following notation to emphasise that the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) matrix consists of \\(n\\) rows or \\(p\\) columns: \\[ \\mathbf{X}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{x}_{1,\\cdot} \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_{2,\\cdot} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\mathbf{x}_{n,\\cdot} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,1} &amp; \\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) is a row vector of length \\(p\\), i.e., a \\((1\\times p)\\)-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{i,1} &amp; x_{i,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{i,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] Moreover, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,j}\\) is a column vector of length \\(n\\), i.e., an \\((n\\times 1)\\)-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,j} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{1,j} &amp; x_{2,j} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,j} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]^T=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} {x}_{1,j} \\\\ {x}_{2,j} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ {x}_{n,j} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right], \\] where \\(\\cdot^T\\) denotes the transpose of a given matrix – think of this as a kind of rotation; it allows us to introduce a set of “vertically stacked” objects using a single inline formula. 1.2.2 Desired Outputs In supervised learning, apart from the inputs we are also given the corresponding reference/desired outputs. The aim of supervised learning is to try to create an “algorithm” that, given an input point, generates an output that is as close as possible to the desired one. The given data sample will be used to “train” this “model”. Usually the reference outputs are encoded as individual numbers (scalars) or textual labels. In other words, with each input \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) we associate the desired output \\(y_i\\): # in iris, iris[, 5] gives the Ys iris[sample(nrow(iris), 3), ] # three random rows ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 14 4.3 3.0 1.1 0.1 setosa ## 50 5.0 3.3 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 118 7.7 3.8 6.7 2.2 virginica Hence, our dataset is \\([\\mathbf{X}\\ \\mathbf{y}]\\) – each object is represented as a row vector \\([\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\ y_i]\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\): \\[ [\\mathbf{X}\\ \\mathbf{y}]= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} &amp; y_1\\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} &amp; y_2\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} &amp; y_n\\\\ \\end{array} \\right], \\] where: \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} y_{1} &amp; y_{2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_{n} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]^T=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} {y}_{1} \\\\ {y}_{2} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ {y}_{n} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] 1.2.3 Types of Supervised Learning Problems Depending on the type of the elements in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) (the domain of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\)), supervised learning problems are usually classified as: regression – each \\(y_i\\) is a real number e.g., \\(y_i=\\) future market stock price with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}=\\) prices from \\(p\\) previous days classification – each \\(y_i\\) is a discrete label e.g., \\(y_i=\\) healthy (0) or ill (1) with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}=\\) a patient’s health record ordinal regression (a.k.a. ordinal classification) – each \\(y_i\\) is a rank e.g., \\(y_i=\\) rating of a product on the scale 1–5 with \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}=\\) ratings of \\(p\\) most similar products Exercise. Example Problems – Discussion: Which of the following are instances of classification problems? Which of them are regression tasks? What kind of data should you gather in order to tackle them? Detect email spam Predict a market stock price Predict the likeability of a new ad Assess credit risk Detect tumour tissues in medical images Predict time-to-recovery of cancer patients Recognise smiling faces on photographs Detect unattended luggage in airport security camera footage Turn on emergency braking to avoid a collision with pedestrians A single dataset can become an instance of many different ML problems. Examples – the wines dataset: wines &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/winequality-all.csv&quot;, comment=&quot;#&quot;) wines[1,] ## fixed.acidity volatile.acidity citric.acid residual.sugar chlorides ## 1 7.4 0.7 0 1.9 0.076 ## free.sulfur.dioxide total.sulfur.dioxide density pH sulphates ## 1 11 34 0.9978 3.51 0.56 ## alcohol response color ## 1 9.4 5 red alcohol is a numeric (quantitative) variable (see Figure 1.1 for a histogram depicting its empirical distribution): summary(wines$alcohol) # continuous variable ## Min. 1st Qu.

Note that although the ranks are represented with numbers, we they are not continuous variables. Moreover, these ranks are something more than just labels – they are linearly ordered, we know what’s the smallest rank and whats the greatest one. table(wines$response) # ordinal variable ## ## 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 30 216 2138 2836 1079 193 5 barplot(table(wines$response), col=&quot;white&quot;, ylim=c(0, 3000)) Figure 1.3: Ordinal variables constitute ordinal regression tasks 1.3 Simple Regression 1.3.1 Introduction Simple regression is the easiest setting to start with – let’s assume \\(p=1\\), i.e., all inputs are 1-dimensional. Denote \\(x_i=x_{i,1}\\). We will use it to build many intuitions, for example, it’ll be easy to illustrate all the concepts graphically. library(&quot;ISLR&quot;) # Credit dataset plot(Credit$Balance, Credit$Rating) # scatter plot Figure 1.4: A scatter plot of Rating vs. Balance In what follows we will be modelling the Credit Rating (\\(Y\\)) as a function of the average Credit Card Balance (\\(X\\)) in USD for customers with positive Balance only. It is because it is evident from Figure 1.4 that some customers with zero balance obtained a credit rating based on some external data source that we don’t have access to in our very setting. X &lt;- as.matrix(as.numeric(Credit$Balance[Credit$Balance&gt;0])) Y &lt;- as.matrix(as.numeric(Credit$Rating[Credit$Balance&gt;0])) Figure 1.5 gives the updated scatter plot with the zero-balance clients “taken care of”. plot(X, Y, xlab=&quot;X (Balance)&quot;, ylab=&quot;Y (Rating)&quot;) Figure 1.5: A scatter plot of Rating vs. Balance with clients of Balance=0 removed Our aim is to construct a function \\(f\\) that models Rating as a function of Balance, \\(f(X)=Y\\). We are equipped with \\(n=310\\) reference (observed) Ratings \\(\\mathbf{y}=[y_1\\ \\cdots\\ y_n]^T\\) for particular Balances \\(\\mathbf{x}=[x_1\\ \\cdots\\ x_n]^T\\). Note the following naming conventions: Variable types: \\(X\\) – independent/explanatory/predictor variable \\(Y\\) – dependent/response/predicted variable Also note that: \\(Y\\) – idealisation (any possible Rating) \\(\\mathbf{y}=[y_1\\ \\cdots\\ y_n]^T\\) – values actually observed The model will not be ideal, but it might be usable: We will be able to predict the rating of any new client. What should be the rating of a client with Balance of $1500? What should be the rating of a client with Balance of $2500? We will be able to describe (understand) this reality using a single mathematical formula so as to infer that there is an association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) Think of “data compression” and laws of physics, e.g., \\(E=mc^2\\). (*) Mathematically, we will assume that there is some “true” function that models the data (true relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\)), but the observed outputs are subject to additive error: \\[Y=f(X)+\\varepsilon.\\] \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a random term, classically we assume that errors are independent of each other, have expected value of \\(0\\) (there is no systematic error = unbiased) and that they follow a normal distribution. (*) We denote this as \\(\\varepsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\) (read: random variable \\(\\varepsilon\\) follows a normal distribution with expected value of \\(0\\) and standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\) for some \\(\\sigma\\ge 0\\)). \\(\\sigma\\) controls the amount of noise (and hence, uncertainty). Figure 1.6 gives the plot of the probability distribution function (PDFs, densities) of \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\\) for different \\(\\sigma\\)s: Figure 1.6: Probability density functions of normal distributions with different standard deviations \\(\\sigma\\). 1.3.2 Search Space and Objective There are many different functions that can be fitted into the observed \\((\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\), compare Figure 1.7. Some of them are better than the other (with respect to different aspects, such as fit quality, simplicity etc.). Figure 1.7: Different polynomial models fitted to data Thus, we need a formal model selection criterion that could enable as to tackle the model fitting task on a computer. Usually, we will be interested in a model that minimises appropriately aggregated residuals \\(f(x_i)-y_i\\), i.e., predicted outputs minus observed outputs, often denoted with \\(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\), for \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). Figure 1.8: Residuals are defined as the differences between the predicted and observed outputs \\(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\) In Figure 1.8, the residuals correspond to the lengths of the dashed line segments – they measure the discrepancy between the outputs generated by the model (what we get) and the true outputs (what we want). Note that some sources define residuals as \\(y_i-\\hat{y}_i=y_i-f(x_i)\\). Top choice: sum of squared residuals: \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} \\mathrm{SSR}(f|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) &amp; = \\left( f(x_1)-y_1 \\right)^2 + \\dots + \\left( f(x_n)-y_n \\right)^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( f(x_i)-y_i \\right)^2 \\end{array} \\] Remark. Read “\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i\\)” as “the sum of \\(z_i\\) for \\(i\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\)”; this is just a shorthand for \\(z_1+z_2+\\dots+z_n\\). Remark. The notation \\(\\mathrm{SSR}(f|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\) means that it is the error measure corresponding to the model \\((f)\\) given our data. We could’ve denoted it with \\(\\mathrm{SSR}_{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}}(f)\\) or even \\(\\mathrm{SSR}(f)\\) to emphasise that \\(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\) are just fixed values and we are not interested in changing them at all (they are “global variables”). We enjoy SSR because (amongst others): larger errors are penalised much more than smaller ones (this can be considered a drawback as well) (**) statistically speaking, this has a clear underlying interpretation (assuming errors are normally distributed, finding a model minimising the SSR is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation) the models minimising the SSR can often be found easily (corresponding optimisation tasks have an analytic solution – studied already by Gauss in the late 18th century) (**) Other choices: regularised SSR, e.g., lasso or ridge regression (in the case of multiple input variables) sum or median of absolute values (robust regression) Fitting a model to data can be written as an optimisation problem: \\[ \\min_{f\\in\\mathcal{F}} \\mathrm{SSR}(f|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}), \\] i.e., find \\(f\\) minimising the SSR (seek “best” \\(f\\)) amongst the set of admissible models \\(\\mathcal{F}\\). Example \\(\\mathcal{F}\\)s: \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{\\text{All possible functions of one variable}\\}\\) – if there are no repeated \\(x_i\\)’s, this corresponds to data interpolation; note that there are many functions that give SSR of \\(0\\). \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{ x\\mapsto x^2, x\\mapsto \\cos(x), x\\mapsto \\exp(2x+7)-9 \\}\\) – obviously an ad-hoc choice but you can easily choose the best amongst the 3 by computing 3 sums of squares. \\(\\mathcal{F}=\\{ x\\mapsto a+bx\\}\\) – the space of linear functions of one variable etc. (e.g., \\(x\\mapsto x^2\\) is read “\\(x\\) maps to \\(x^2\\)” and is an elegant way to define an inline function \\(f\\) such that \\(f(x)=x^2\\)) 1.4 Simple Linear Regression 1.4.1 Introduction If the family of admissible models \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consists only of all linear functions of one variable, we deal with a simple linear regression. Our problem becomes: \\[ \\min_{a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( a+bx_i-y_i \\right)^2 \\] In other words, we seek best fitting line in terms of the squared residuals. This is the method of least squares. This is particularly nice, because our search space is just \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) – easy to handle both analytically and numerically. Figure 1.9: Three simple linear models together with the corresponding SSRs Exercise. Which of the lines in Figure 1.9 is the least squares solution? 1.4.2 Solution in R Let’s fit the linear model minimising the SSR in R. The lm() function (linear models) has a convenient formula-based interface. f &lt;- lm(Y~X) In R, the expression “Y~X” denotes a formula, which we read as: variable Y is a function of X. Note that the dependent variable is on the left side of the formula. Here, X and Y are two R numeric vectors of identical lengths. Let’s print the fitted model: print(f) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Y ~ X) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) X ## 226.471 0.266 Hence, the fitted model is: \\[ Y = f(X) = 226.47114+0.26615 X \\qquad (+ \\varepsilon) \\] Coefficient \\(a\\) (intercept): f$coefficient[1] ## (Intercept) ## 226.47 Coefficient \\(b\\) (slope): f$coefficient[2] ## X ## 0.26615 Plotting, see Figure 1.10: plot(X, Y, col=&quot;#000000aa&quot;) abline(f, col=2, lwd=3) Figure 1.10: Fitted regression line SSR: sum(f$residuals^2) ## [1] 2132108 sum((f$coefficient[1]+f$coefficient[2]*X-Y)^2) # equivalent ## [1] 2132108 We can predict the model’s output for yet-unobserved inputs by writing: X_new &lt;- c(1500, 2000, 2500) # example inputs f$coefficient[1] + f$coefficient[2]*X_new ## [1] 625.69 758.76 891.84 Note that linear models can also be fitted based on formulas that refer to a data frame’s columns. For example, let us wrap both \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) inside a data frame: XY &lt;- data.frame(Balance=X, Rating=Y) head(XY, 3) ## Balance Rating ## 1 333 283 ## 2 903 483 ## 3 580 514 By writing: f &lt;- lm(Rating~Balance, data=XY) now Balance and Rating refer to column names in the XY data frame, and not the objects in R’s “workspace”. Based on the above, we can make a prediction using the predict() function\" X_new &lt;- data.frame(Balance=c(1500, 2000, 2500)) predict(f, X_new) ## 1 2 3 ## 625.69 758.76 891.84 Interestingly: predict(f, data.frame(Balance=c(5000))) ## 1 ## 1557.2 This is more than the highest possible rating – we have extrapolated way beyond the observable data range. Note that our \\(Y=a+bX\\) model is interpretable and well-behaving (not all machine learning models will have this feature, think: deep neural networks, which we rather conceive as black boxes): we know that by increasing \\(X\\) by a small amount, \\(Y\\) will also increase (positive correlation), the model is continuous – small change in \\(X\\) doesn’t yield any drastic change in \\(Y\\), we know what will happen if we increase or decrease \\(X\\) by, say, \\(100\\), the function is invertible – if we want Rating of \\(500\\), we can compute the associated preferred Balance that should yield it (provided that the model is valid). 1.4.3 Analytic Solution It may be shown (which we actually do below) that the solution is: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} b = &amp; \\dfrac{ n \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i }{ n \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i }\\\\ a = &amp; \\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - b \\dfrac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Which can be implemented in R as follows: n &lt;- length(X) b &lt;- (n*sum(X*Y)-sum(X)*sum(Y))/(n*sum(X*X)-sum(X)^2) a &lt;- mean(Y)-b*mean(X) c(a, b) # the same as f$coefficients ## [1] 226.47114 0.26615 1.4.4 Derivation of the Solution (**) Remark. You can safely skip this part if you are yet to know how to search for a minimum of a function of many variables and what are partial derivatives. Denote with: \\[ E(a,b)=\\mathrm{SSR}(x\\mapsto a+bx|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( a+bx_i - y_i \\right) ^2. \\] We seek the minimum of \\(E\\) w.r.t. both \\(a,b\\). Theorem. If \\(E\\) has a (local) minimum at \\((a^*,b^*)\\), then its partial derivatives vanish therein, i.e., \\(\\partial E/\\partial a(a^*, b^*) = 0\\) and \\(\\partial E/\\partial b(a^*, b^*)=0\\). We have: \\[ E(a,b) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( a+bx_i - y_i \\right) ^2. \\] We need to compute the partial derivatives \\(\\partial E/\\partial a\\) (derivative of \\(E\\) w.r.t. variable \\(a\\) – all other terms treated as constants) and \\(\\partial E/\\partial b\\) (w.r.t. \\(b\\)). Useful rules – derivatives w.r.t. \\(a\\) (denote \\(f&#39;(a)=(f(a))&#39;\\)): \\((f(a)+g(a))&#39;=f&#39;(a)+g&#39;(a)\\) (derivative of sum is sum of derivatives) \\((f(a) g(a))&#39; = f&#39;(a)g(a) + f(a)g&#39;(a)\\) (derivative of product) \\((f(g(a)))&#39; = f&#39;(g(a)) g&#39;(a)\\) (chain rule) \\((c)&#39; = 0\\) for any constant \\(c\\) (expression not involving \\(a\\)) \\((a^p)&#39; = pa^{p-1}\\) for any \\(p\\) in particular: \\((c a^2+d)&#39;=2ca\\), \\((ca)&#39;=c\\), \\(((ca+d)^2)&#39;=2(ca+d)c\\) (application of the above rules) We seek \\(a,b\\) such that \\(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial a}(a,b) = 0\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial b}(a,b)=0\\). \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial a}(a,b)=&amp;2\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( a+bx_i - y_i \\right) = 0\\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial b}(a,b)=&amp;2\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( a+bx_i - y_i \\right) x_i = 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] This is a system of 2 linear equations. Easy. Rearranging like back in the school days: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} b \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i+ a n = &amp; \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\ b \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i + a \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = &amp; \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] It is left as an exercise to show that the solution is: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} b^* = &amp; \\dfrac{ n \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i }{ n \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i }\\\\ a^* = &amp; \\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - b^* \\dfrac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] (we should additionally perform the second derivative test to assure that this is the minimum of \\(E\\) – which is exactly the case though) (**) In the next chapter, we will introduce the notion of Pearson’s linear coefficient, \\(r\\) (see cor() in R). It might be shown that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can also be rewritten as: (b &lt;- cor(X,Y)*sd(Y)/sd(X)) ## [,1] ## [1,] 0.26615 (a &lt;- mean(Y)-b*mean(X)) ## [,1] ## [1,] 226.47 1.5 Exercises in R 1.5.1 The Anscombe Quartet Here is a famous illustrative example proposed by the statistician Francis Anscombe in the early 1970s. print(anscombe) # `anscombe` is a built-in object ## x1 x2 x3 x4 y1 y2 y3 y4 ## 1 10 10 10 8 8.04 9.14 7.46 6.58 ## 2 8 8 8 8 6.95 8.14 6.77 5.76 ## 3 13 13 13 8 7.58 8.74 12.74 7.71 ## 4 9 9 9 8 8.81 8.77 7.11 8.84 ## 5 11 11 11 8 8.33 9.26 7.81 8.47 ## 6 14 14 14 8 9.96 8.10 8.84 7.04 ## 7 6 6 6 8 7.24 6.13 6.08 5.25 ## 8 4 4 4 19 4.26 3.10 5.39 12.50 ## 9 12 12 12 8 10.84 9.13 8.15 5.56 ## 10 7 7 7 8 4.82 7.26 6.42 7.91 ## 11 5 5 5 8 5.68 4.74 5.73 6.89 What we see above is a single data frame that encodes four separate datasets: anscombe$x1 and anscombe$y1 define the first pair of variables, anscombe$x2 and anscombe$y2 define the second pair and so forth. Exercise. Split the above data (manually) into four data frames ans1, …, ans4 with columns x and y. For example, ans1 should look like: print(ans1) ## x y ## 1 10 8.04 ## 2 8 6.95 ## 3 13 7.58 ## 4 9 8.81 ## 5 11 8.33 ## 6 14 9.96 ## 7 6 7.24 ## 8 4 4.26 ## 9 12 10.84 ## 10 7 4.82 ## 11 5 5.68 Click here for a solution. ans1 &lt;- data.frame(x=anscombe$x1, y=anscombe$y1) ans2 &lt;- data.frame(x=anscombe$x2, y=anscombe$y2) ans3 &lt;- data.frame(x=anscombe$x3, y=anscombe$y3) ans4 &lt;- data.frame(x=anscombe$x4, y=anscombe$y4) print(ans1) Exercise.

Exercise. Compute the standard deviation of each x and y variable. Click here for a solution. The solution is similar to the previous one, just replace mean with sd. Here, to learn something new, we will use the knitr::kable() function that pretty-prints a given matrix or data frame: results &lt;- sapply(anscombe, sd) knitr::kable(results, col.names=&quot;standard deviation&quot;) standard deviation x1 3.3166 x2 3.3166 x3 3.3166 x4 3.3166 y1 2.0316 y2 2.0317 y3 2.0304 y4 2.0306 Comment: This is even more interesting, because the numbers agree up to 2 decimal digits. Exercise. Fit a simple linear regression model for each data set. Draw the scatter plots again (plot()) and add the regression lines (lines() or abline()). Click here for a solution. To recall, this can be done with the lm() function explained in Lecture 2. At this point we should already have become lazy – the tasks are very repetitious. Let’s automate them by writing a single function that does all the above for any data set: fit_models &lt;- function(ans) { # ans is a data frame with columns x and y f &lt;- lm(y~x, data=ans) # fit linear model print(f$coefficients) # estimated coefficients plot(ans$x, ans$y) # scatter plot abline(f, col=&quot;red&quot;) # regression line return(f) } Now we can apply it on the four particular examples. par(mfrow=c(2, 2)) # four plots on 1 figure (2x2 grid) f1 &lt;- fit_models(ans1) ## (Intercept) x ## 3.00009 0.50009 f2 &lt;- fit_models(ans2) ## (Intercept) x ## 3.0009 0.5000 f3 &lt;- fit_models(ans3) ## (Intercept) x ## 3.00245 0.49973 f4 &lt;- fit_models(ans4) ## (Intercept) x ## 3.00173 0.49991 Figure 1.11: Fitted regression lines for the Anscombe quartet Comment: All the estimated models are virtually the same, the regression lines are \\(y=0.5x+3\\), compare Figure 1.11. Exercise. Create scatter plots of the residuals (predicted \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) minus true \\(y_i\\)) as a function of the predicted \\(\\hat{y}_i=f(x_i)\\) for every \\(i=1,\\dots,11\\). Click here for a solution. To recall, the model predictions can be generated by (amongst others) calling the predict() function. y_pred1 &lt;- f1$fitted.values # predict(f1, ans1) y_pred2 &lt;- f2$fitted.values # predict(f2, ans2) y_pred3 &lt;- f3$fitted.values # predict(f3, ans3) y_pred4 &lt;- f4$fitted.values # predict(f4, ans4) Plots of residuals as a function of the predicted (fitted) values are given in Figure 1.12. par(mfrow=c(2, 2)) # four plots on 1 figure (2x2 grid) plot(y_pred1, y_pred1-ans1$y) plot(y_pred2, y_pred2-ans2$y) plot(y_pred3, y_pred3-ans3$y) plot(y_pred4, y_pred4-ans4$y) Figure 1.12: Residuals vs. fitted values for the regression lines fitted to the Anscombe quartet Comment: Ideally, the residuals shouldn’t be correlated with the predicted values – they should “oscillate” randomly around 0. This is only the case of the first dataset. All the other cases are “alarming” in the sense that they suggest that the obtained models are “suspicious” (perhaps data cleansing is needed or a linear model is not at all appropriate). Exercise. Draw conclusions (in your own words). Click here for a solution. We’re being taught a lesson here: don’t perform data analysis tasks automatically, don’t look at bare numbers only, visualise your data first! Exercise.

Learning a model = constructing a function that approximates (minimising some error measure) the given data. Regression = the output variable \\(Y\\) is continuous. We studied linear models with a single independent variable based on the least squares (SSR) fit. In the next part we will extend this setting to the case of many variables, i.e., \\(p&gt;1\\), called multiple regression. 1.6.2 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (James et al. 2017: Chapters 1, 2 and 3) Other: (Hastie et al. 2017: Chapter 1, Sections 3.2 and 3.3) References "],

There will be not much work on-going in this repository anymore, as its sources have moved elsewhere; however, if you happen to find any bugs or typos, please drop me an email. I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. 2.1 Introduction 2.1.1 Formalism Let \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) be an input matrix that consists of \\(n\\) points in a \\(p\\)-dimensional space. In other words, we have a database on \\(n\\) objects, each of which being described by means of \\(p\\) numerical features. \\[ \\mathbf{X}= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} \\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] Recall that in supervised learning, apart from \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), we are also given the corresponding \\(\\mathbf{y}\\); with each input point \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) we associate the desired output \\(y_i\\). In this chapter we are still interested in regression tasks; hence, we assume that each \\(y_i\\) it is a real number, i.e., \\(y_i\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). Hence, our dataset is \\([\\mathbf{X}\\ \\mathbf{y}]\\) – where each object is represented as a row vector \\([\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\ y_i]\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\): \\[ [\\mathbf{X}\\ \\mathbf{y}]= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} &amp; y_1\\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} &amp; y_2\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} &amp; y_n\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] 2.1.2 Simple Linear Regression - Recap In a simple regression task, we have assumed that \\(p=1\\) – there is only one independent variable, denoted \\(x_i=x_{i,1}\\). We restricted ourselves to linear models of the form \\(Y=f(X)=a+bX\\) that minimised the sum of squared residuals (SSR), i.e., \\[ \\min_{a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( a+bx_i-y_i \\right)^2. \\] The solution is: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} b = &amp; \\dfrac{ n \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i }{ n \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i }\\\\ a = &amp; \\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - b \\dfrac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Fitting in R can be performed by calling the lm() function: library(&quot;ISLR&quot;) # Credit dataset X &lt;- as.numeric(Credit$Balance[Credit$Balance&gt;0]) Y &lt;- as.numeric(Credit$Rating[Credit$Balance&gt;0]) f &lt;- lm(Y~X) # Y~X is a formula, read: Y is a function of X print(f) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Y ~ X) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) X ## 226.471 0.266 Figure 2.1 gives the scatter plot of Y vs. X together with the fitted simple linear model. plot(X, Y, xlab=&quot;X (Balance)&quot;, ylab=&quot;Y (Credit)&quot;) abline(f, col=2, lwd=3) Figure 2.1: Fitted regression line for the Credit dataset 2.2 Multiple Linear Regression 2.2.1 Problem Formulation Let’s now generalise the above to the case of many variables \\(X_1, \\dots, X_p\\). We wish to model the dependent variable as a function of \\(p\\) independent variables. \\[ Y = f(X_1,\\dots,X_p) \\qquad (+\\varepsilon) \\] Restricting ourselves to the class of linear models, we have \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p. \\] Above we studied the case where \\(p=1\\), i.e., \\(Y=a+bX_1\\) with \\(\\beta_0=a\\) and \\(\\beta_1=b\\). The above equation defines: \\(p=1\\) — a line (see Figure 2.1), \\(p=2\\) — a plane (see Figure 2.2), \\(p\\ge 3\\) — a hyperplane (well, most people find it difficult to imagine objects in high dimensions, but we are lucky to have this thing called maths). Figure 2.2: Fitted regression plane for the Credit dataset 2.2.2 Fitting a Linear Model in R lm() accepts a formula of the form Y~X1+X2+...+Xp. It finds the least squares fit, i.e., solves \\[ \\min_{\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\dots, \\beta_p\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_i \\right) ^2 \\] X1 &lt;- as.numeric(Credit$Balance[Credit$Balance&gt;0]) X2 &lt;- as.numeric(Credit$Income[Credit$Balance&gt;0]) Y &lt;- as.numeric(Credit$Rating[Credit$Balance&gt;0]) f &lt;- lm(Y~X1+X2) f$coefficients # ß0, ß1, ß2 ## (Intercept) X1 X2 ## 172.5587 0.1828 2.1976 By the way, the 3D scatter plot in Figure 2.2 was generated by calling: library(&quot;scatterplot3d&quot;) s3d &lt;- scatterplot3d(X1, X2, Y, angle=60, # change angle to reveal more highlight.3d=TRUE, xlab=&quot;Balance&quot;, ylab=&quot;Income&quot;, zlab=&quot;Rating&quot;) s3d$plane3d(f, lty.box=&quot;solid&quot;) (s3d is an R list, one of its elements named plane3d is a function object – this is legal) 2.3 Finding the Best Model 2.3.1 Model Diagnostics Here is Rating (\\(Y\\)) as function of Balance (\\(X_1\\), lefthand side of Figure 2.3) and Income (\\(X_2\\), righthand side of Figure 2.3). Figure 2.3: Scatter plots of \\(Y\\) vs. \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) Moreover, Figure 2.4 depicts (in a hopefully readable manner) both \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) with Rating \\(Y\\) encoded with a colour (low ratings are green, high ratings are red; some rating values are explicitly printed out within the plot). Figure 2.4: A heatmap for Rating as a function of Balance and Income; greens represent low credit ratings, whereas reds – high ones Consider the three following models. Formula Equation Rating ~ Balance + Income \\(Y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2\\) Rating ~ Balance \\(Y=a + b X_1\\) (\\(\\beta_0=a, \\beta_1=b, \\beta_2=0\\)) Rating ~ Income \\(Y=a + b X_2\\) (\\(\\beta_0=a, \\beta_1=0, \\beta_2=b\\)) f12 &lt;- lm(Y~X1+X2) # Rating ~ Balance + Income f12$coefficients ## (Intercept) X1 X2 ## 172.5587 0.1828 2.1976 f1 &lt;- lm(Y~X1) # Rating ~ Balance f1$coefficients ## (Intercept) X1 ## 226.47114 0.26615 f2 &lt;- lm(Y~X2) # Rating ~ Income f2$coefficients ## (Intercept) X2 ## 253.8514 3.0253 Which of the three models is the best? Of course, by using the word “best”, we need to answer the question “best?… but with respect to what kind of measure?” So far we were fitting w.r.t. SSR, as the multiple regression model generalises the two simple ones, the former must yield a not-worse SSR. This is because in the case of \\(Y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2\\), setting \\(\\beta_1\\) to 0 (just one of uncountably many possible \\(\\beta_1\\)s, if it happens to be the best one, good for us) gives \\(Y=a + b X_2\\) whereas by setting \\(\\beta_2\\) to 0 we obtain \\(Y=a + b X_1\\). sum(f12$residuals^2) ## [1] 358261 sum(f1$residuals^2) ## [1] 2132108 sum(f2$residuals^2) ## [1] 1823473 We get that, in terms of SSRs, \\(f_{12}\\) is better than \\(f_{2}\\), which in turn is better than \\(f_{1}\\). However, these error values per se (sheer numbers) are meaningless (not meaningful). Remark. Interpretability in ML has always been an important issue, think the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), amongst others. 2.3.1.1 SSR, MSE, RMSE and MAE The quality of fit can be assessed by performing some descriptive statistical analysis of the residuals, \\(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\), for \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). I know how to summarise data on the residuals! Of course I should compute their arithmetic mean and I’m done with that shtask! Interestingly, the mean of residuals (this can be shown analytically) in the least squared fit is always equal to \\(0\\): \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y}_i-y_i)=0. \\] Therefore, we need a different metric. Exercise. (*) A proof of this fact is left as an exercise to the curious; assume \\(p=1\\) just as in the previous chapter and note that \\(\\hat{y}_i=a x_i+b\\). mean(f12$residuals) # almost zero numerically ## [1] -2.0867e-16 all.equal(mean(f12$residuals), 0) ## [1] TRUE We noted that sum of squared residuals (SSR) is not interpretable, but the mean squared residuals (MSR) – also called mean squared error (MSE) regression loss – is a little better. Recall that mean is defined as the sum divided by number of samples. \\[ \\mathrm{MSE}(f) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (f(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot})-y_i)^2. \\] mean(f12$residuals^2) ## [1] 1155.7 mean(f1$residuals^2) ## [1] 6877.8 mean(f2$residuals^2) ## [1] 5882.2 This gives an information of how much do we err per sample, so at least this measure does not depend on \\(n\\) anymore. However, if the original \\(Y\\)s are, say, in metres \\([\\mathrm{m}]\\), MSE is expressed in metres squared \\([\\mathrm{m}^2]\\). To account for that, we may consider the root mean squared error (RMSE): \\[ \\mathrm{RMSE}(f) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (f(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot})-y_i)^2}. \\] This is just like with the sample variance vs. standard deviation – recall the latter is defined as the square root of the former. sqrt(mean(f12$residuals^2)) ## [1] 33.995 sqrt(mean(f1$residuals^2)) ## [1] 82.932 sqrt(mean(f2$residuals^2)) ## [1] 76.695 The interpretation of the RMSE is rather quirky; it is some-sort-of-averaged deviance from the true rating (which is on the scale 0–1000, hence we see that the first model is not that bad). Recall that the square function is sensitive to large observations, hence, it penalises notable deviations more heavily. As still we have a problem with finding something easily interpretable (your non-technical boss or client may ask you: but what do these numbers mean??), we suggest here that the mean absolute error (MAE; also called mean absolute deviations, MAD) might be a better idea than the above: \\[ \\mathrm{MAE}(f) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n |f(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot})-y_i|. \\] mean(abs(f12$residuals)) ## [1] 22.863 mean(abs(f1$residuals)) ## [1] 61.489 mean(abs(f2$residuals)) ## [1] 64.151 With the above we may say “On average, the predicted rating differs from the observed one by…”. That is good enough. Remark. (*) You may ask why don’t we fit models so as to minimise the MAE and we minimise the RMSE instead (note that minimising RMSE is the same as minimising the SSR, one is a strictly monotone transformation of the other and do not affect the solution). Well, it is possible. It turns out that, however, minimising MAE is more computationally expensive and the solution may be numerically unstable. So it’s rarely an analyst’s first choice (assuming they are well-educated enough to know about the MAD regression task). However, it may be worth trying it out sometimes. Sometimes we might prefer MAD regression to the classic one if our data is heavily contaminated by outliers. But in such cases it is worth checking if proper data cleansing does the trick. 2.3.1.2 Graphical Summaries of Residuals If we are not happy with single numerical aggregated of the residuals or their absolute values, we can (and should) always compute a whole bunch of descriptive statistics: summary(f12$residuals) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## -108.10 -1.94 7.81 0.00 20.25 50.62 summary(f1$residuals) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## -226.8 -48.3 -10.1 0.0 42.6 268.7 summary(f2$residuals) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## -195.16 -57.34 -1.28 0.00 64.01 175.34 The outputs generated by summary() include: Min. – sample minimum 1st Qu. – 1st quartile == 25th percentile == quantile of order 0.25 Median – median == 50th percentile == quantile of order 0.5 3rd Qu. – 3rd quartile = 75th percentile == quantile of order 0.75 Max. – sample maximum For example, 1st quartile is the observation \\(q\\) such that 25% values are \\(\\le q\\) and 75% values are \\(\\ge q\\), see ?quantile in R. Graphically, it is nice to summarise the empirical distribution of the residuals on a box and whisker plot. Here is the key to decipher Figure 2.5: IQR == Interquartile range == Q3\\(-\\)Q1 (box width) The box contains 50% of the “most typical” observations Box and whiskers altogether have width \\(\\le\\) 4 IQR Outliers == observations potentially worth inspecting (is it a bug or a feature?) Figure 2.5: An example boxplot Figure 2.6 is worth a thousand words: boxplot(horizontal=TRUE, xlab=&quot;residuals&quot;, col=&quot;white&quot;, list(f12=f12$residuals, f1=f1$residuals, f2=f2$residuals)) abline(v=0, lty=3) Figure 2.6: Box plots of the residuals for the three models studied Figure 2.7 gives a violin plot – a blend of a box plot and a (kernel) density estimator (histogram-like): library(&quot;vioplot&quot;) vioplot(horizontal=TRUE, xlab=&quot;residuals&quot;, col=&quot;white&quot;, list(f12=f12$residuals, f1=f1$residuals, f2=f2$residuals)) abline(v=0, lty=3) Figure 2.7: Violin plots of the residuals for the three models studied We can also take a look at the absolute values of the residuals.

It turns out that there is a popular normalised (unit-less) measure that is somehow easy to interpret with no domain-specific knowledge of the modelled problem. Namely, the (unadjusted) \\(R^2\\) score (the coefficient of determination) is given by: \\[ R^2(f) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(y_i-f(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot})\\right)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(y_i-\\bar{y}\\right)^2}, \\] where \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the arithmetic mean \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\). (r12 &lt;- summary(f12)$r.squared) ## [1] 0.93909 1 - sum(f12$residuals^2)/sum((Y-mean(Y))^2) # the same ## [1] 0.93909 (r1 &lt;- summary(f1)$r.squared) ## [1] 0.63751 (r2 &lt;- summary(f2)$r.squared) ## [1] 0.68998 The coefficient of determination gives the proportion of variance of the dependent variable explained by independent variables in the model; \\(R^2(f)\\simeq 1\\) indicates a perfect fit. The first model is a very good one, the simple models are “more or less okay”. Unfortunately, \\(R^2\\) tends to automatically increase as the number of independent variables increase (recall that the more variables in the model, the better the SSR must be). To correct for this phenomenon, we sometimes consider the adjusted \\(R^2\\): \\[ \\bar{R}^2(f) = 1 - (1-{R}^2(f))\\frac{n-1}{n-p-1} \\] summary(f12)$adj.r.squared ## [1] 0.93869 n &lt;- length(x); 1 - (1 - r12)*(n-1)/(n-3) # the same ## [1] 0.93869 summary(f1)$adj.r.squared ## [1] 0.63633 summary(f2)$adj.r.squared ## [1] 0.68897 In other words, the adjusted \\(R^2\\) penalises for more complex models. Remark. (*) Side note – results of some statistical tests (e.g., significance of coefficients) are reported by calling summary(f12) etc. — refer to a more advanced source to obtain more information. These, however, require the verification of some assumptions regarding the input data and the residuals. summary(f12) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Y ~ X1 + X2) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -108.10 -1.94 7.81 20.25 50.62 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

However, it the Credit data set there are other variables possibly worth inspecting. Consider all quantitative (numeric-continuous) variables in the Credit data set. C &lt;- Credit[Credit$Balance&gt;0, c(&quot;Rating&quot;, &quot;Limit&quot;, &quot;Income&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;, &quot;Balance&quot;)] head(C) ## Rating Limit Income Age Education Balance ## 1 283 3606 14.891 34 11 333 ## 2 483 6645 106.025 82 15 903 ## 3 514 7075 104.593 71 11 580 ## 4 681 9504 148.924 36 11 964 ## 5 357 4897 55.882 68 16 331 ## 6 569 8047 80.180 77 10 1151 Obviously there are many possible combinations of the variables upon which regression models can be constructed (precisely, for \\(p\\) variables there are \\(2^p\\) such models). How do we choose the best set of inputs? Remark. We should already be suspicious at this point: wait… best requires some sort of criterion, right? First, however, let’s draw a matrix of scatter plots for every pair of variables – so as to get an impression of how individual variables interact with each other, see Figure 2.10. pairs(C) Figure 2.10: Scatter plot matrix for the Credit dataset It seems like Rating depends on Limit almost linearly… We have a tool to actually quantify the degree of linear dependence between a pair of variables – Pearson’s \\(r\\) – the linear correlation coefficient: \\[ r(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x}) (y_i-\\bar{y}) }{ \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x})^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\bar{y})^2} }. \\] It holds \\(r\\in[-1,1]\\), where: \\(r=1\\) – positive linear dependence (\\(y\\) increases as \\(x\\) increases) \\(r=-1\\) – negative linear dependence (\\(y\\) decreases as \\(x\\) increases) \\(r\\simeq 0\\) – uncorrelated or non-linearly dependent Figure 2.11 gives an illustration of the above. Figure 2.11: Different datasets and the corresponding Pearson’s \\(r\\) coefficients To compute Pearson’s \\(r\\) between all pairs of variables, we call: round(cor(C), 3) ## Rating Limit Income Age Education Balance ## Rating 1.000 0.996 0.831 0.167 -0.040 0.798 ## Limit 0.996 1.000 0.834 0.164 -0.032 0.796 ## Income 0.831 0.834 1.000 0.227 -0.033 0.414 ## Age 0.167 0.164 0.227 1.000 0.024 0.008 ## Education -0.040 -0.032 -0.033 0.024 1.000 0.001 ## Balance 0.798 0.796 0.414 0.008 0.001 1.000 Rating and Limit are almost perfectly linearly correlated, and both seem to describe the same thing. For practical purposes, we’d rather model Rating as a function of the other variables. For simple linear regression models, we’d choose either Income or Balance. How about multiple regression though? The best model: has high predictive power, is simple. These two criteria are often mutually exclusive. Which variables should be included in the optimal model? Again, the definition of the “best” object needs a fitness function. For fitting a single model to data, we use the SSR. We need a metric that takes the number of dependent variables into account. Remark. (*) Unfortunately, the adjusted \\(R^2\\), despite its interpretability, is not really suitable for this task. It does not penalise complex models heavily enough to be really useful. Here we’ll be using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For a model \\(f\\) with \\(p&#39;\\) independent variables: \\[ \\mathrm{AIC}(f) = 2(p&#39;+1)+n\\log(\\mathrm{SSR}(f))-n\\log n \\] Our task is to find the combination of independent variables that minimises the AIC. Remark. (**) Note that this is a bi-level optimisation problem – for every considered combination of variables (which we look for), we must solve another problem of finding the best model involving these variables – the one that minimises the SSR. \\[ \\min_{s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_p\\in\\{0, 1\\}} \\left( \\begin{array}{l} 2\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^p s_j +1\\right)+\\\\ n\\log\\left( \\displaystyle\\min_{\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + s_1\\beta_1 x_{i,1} + \\dots + s_p\\beta_p x_{i,p} -y_i \\right)^2 \\right) \\end{array} \\right) \\] We dropped the \\(n\\log n\\) term, because it is always constant and hence doesn’t affect the solution. If \\(s_j=0\\), then the \\(s_j\\beta_j x_{i,j}\\) term is equal to \\(0\\), and hence is not considered in the model. This plays the role of including \\(s_j=1\\) or omitting \\(s_j=0\\) the \\(j\\)-th variable in the model building exercise. For \\(p\\) variables, the number of their possible combinations is equal to \\(2^p\\) (grows exponentially with \\(p\\)). For large \\(p\\) (think big data), an extensive search is impractical (in our case we could get away with this though – left as an exercise to a slightly more advanced reader). Therefore, to find the variable combination minimising the AIC, we often rely on one of the two following greedy heuristics: forward selection: start with an empty model find an independent variable whose addition to the current model would yield the highest decrease in the AIC and add it to the model go to step 2 until AIC decreases backward elimination: start with the full model find an independent variable whose removal from the current model would decrease the AIC the most and eliminate it from the model go to step 2 until AIC decreases Remark. (**) The above bi-level optimisation problem can be solved by implementing a genetic algorithm – see further chapter for more details. Remark. (*) There are of course many other methods which also perform some form of variable selection, e.g., lasso regression. But these minimise a different objective. First, a forward selection example. We need a data sample to work with: C &lt;- Credit[Credit$Balance&gt;0, c(&quot;Rating&quot;, &quot;Income&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;, &quot;Balance&quot;)] Then, a formula that represents a model with no variables (model from which we’ll start our search): (model_empty &lt;- Rating~1) ## Rating ~ 1 Last, we need a model that includes all the variables. We’re too lazy to list all of them manually, therefore, we can use the model.frame() function to generate a corresponding formula: (model_full &lt;- formula(model.frame(Rating~., data=C))) # all variables ## Rating ~ Income + Age + Education + Balance Now we are ready. step(lm(model_empty, data=C), # starting model scope=model_full, # gives variables to consider direction=&quot;forward&quot;) ## Start: AIC=3055.8 ## Rating ~ 1 ## ## Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC ## + Income 1 4058342 1823473 2695 ## + Balance 1 3749707 2132108 2743 ## + Age 1 164567 5717248 3049 ## &lt;none&gt; 5881815 3056 ## + Education 1 9631 5872184 3057 ## ## Step: AIC=2694.7 ## Rating ~ Income ## ## Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC ## + Balance 1 1465212 358261 2192 ## &lt;none&gt; 1823473 2695 ## + Age 1 2836 1820637 2696 ## + Education 1 1063 1822410 2697 ## ## Step: AIC=2192.3 ## Rating ~ Income + Balance ## ## Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC ## + Age 1 4119 354141 2191 ## + Education 1 2692 355568 2192 ## &lt;none&gt; 358261 2192 ## ## Step: AIC=2190.7 ## Rating ~ Income + Balance + Age ## ## Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC ## + Education 1 2926 351216 2190 ## &lt;none&gt; 354141 2191 ## ## Step: AIC=2190.1 ## Rating ~ Income + Balance + Age + Education ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Rating ~ Income + Balance + Age + Education, data = C) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) Income Balance Age Education ## 173.830 2.167 0.184 0.223 -0.960 formula(lm(Rating~., data=C)) ## Rating ~ Income + Age + Education + Balance The full model has been selected.

For example: \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_1^2 + \\beta_3 X_1^3 + \\beta_4 X_2. \\] Solution: pre-process inputs by setting \\(X_1&#39; := X_1\\), \\(X_2&#39; := X_1^2\\), \\(X_3&#39; := X_1^3\\), \\(X_4&#39; := X_2\\) and fit a linear model: \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1&#39; + \\beta_2 X_2&#39; + \\beta_3 X_3&#39; + \\beta_4 X_4&#39;. \\] This trick works for every model of the form \\(Y=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^p \\varphi_{i,j}(X_j)\\) for any \\(k\\) and any univariate functions \\(\\varphi_{i,j}\\). Also, with a little creativity (and maths), we might be able to transform a few other models to a linear one, e.g., \\[ Y = b e^{aX} \\qquad \\to \\qquad \\log Y = \\log b + aX \\qquad\\to\\qquad Y&#39;=aX+b&#39; \\] This is an example of a model’s linearisation. However, not every model can be linearised. In particular, one that involves functions that are not invertible. For example, here’s a series of simple (\\(p=1\\)) degree-\\(d\\) polynomial regression models of the form: \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 X^2 + \\beta_3 X^3 + \\dots + \\beta_d X^d. \\] Such models can be fitted with the lm() function based on the formula of the form Y~poly(X, d, raw=TRUE) or Y~X+I(X^2)+I(X^3)+... f1_1 &lt;- lm(Y~X1) f1_3 &lt;- lm(Y~X1+I(X1^2)+I(X1^3)) # also: Y~poly(X1, 3, raw=TRUE) f1_10 &lt;- lm(Y~poly(X1, 10, raw=TRUE)) Above we have fitted the polynomials of degrees 1, 3 and 10. Note that a polynomial of degree 1 is just a line. Let us depict the three models: plot(X1, Y, col=&quot;#000000aa&quot;, ylim=c(0, 1100)) x &lt;- seq(min(X1), max(X1), length.out=101) lines(x, predict(f1_1, data.frame(X1=x)), col=&quot;red&quot;, lwd=3) lines(x, predict(f1_3, data.frame(X1=x)), col=&quot;blue&quot;, lwd=3) lines(x, predict(f1_10, data.frame(X1=x)), col=&quot;darkgreen&quot;, lwd=3) Figure 2.12: Polynomials of different degrees fitted to the Credit dataset From Figure 2.12 we see that there’s clearly a problem with the degree-10 polynomial. 2.3.4 Predictive vs. Descriptive Power The above high-degree polynomial model (f1_10) is a typical instance of a phenomenon called an overfit. Clearly (based on our expert knowledge), the Rating shouldn’t decrease as Balance increases. In other words, f1_10 gives a better fit to data actually observed, but fails to produce good results for the points that are yet to come. We say that it generalises poorly to unseen data. Assume our true model is of the form: true_model &lt;- function(x) 3*x^3+5 Let’s generate the following random sample from this model (with \\(Y\\) subject to error), see Figure 2.13: set.seed(1234) # to assure reproducibility n &lt;- 25 X &lt;- runif(n, min=0, max=1) Y &lt;- true_model(X)+rnorm(n, sd=0.2) # add normally-distributed noise plot(X, Y) x &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=101) lines(x, true_model(x), col=2, lwd=3, lty=2) Figure 2.13: Synthetic data generated by means of the formula \\(Y=3x^3+5\\) (\\(+\\) noise) Let’s fit polynomials of different degrees, see Figure 2.14. plot(X, Y) lines(x, true_model(x), col=2, lwd=3, lty=2) dmax &lt;- 11 # maximal polynomial degree MSE_train &lt;- numeric(dmax) MSE_test &lt;- numeric(dmax) for (d in 1:dmax) { # for every polynomial degree f &lt;- lm(Y~poly(X, d, raw=TRUE)) # fit a d-degree polynomial y &lt;- predict(f, data.frame(X=x)) lines(x, y, col=d) # MSE on given random X,Y: MSE_train[d] &lt;- mean(f$residuals^2) # MSE on many more points: MSE_test[d] &lt;- mean((y-true_model(x))^2) } Figure 2.14: Polynomials fitted to our synthetic dataset Some of the polynomials are fitted too well! Remark (*) The oscillation of the high-degree polynomials at the domain boundaries is known as the Runge phenomenon. Compare the mean squared error (MSE) for the observed vs. future data points, see Figure 2.15. matplot(1:dmax, cbind(MSE_train, MSE_test), type=&quot;b&quot;, ylim=c(1e-3, 2e3), log=&quot;y&quot;, pch=1:2, xlab=&quot;Model complexity (polynomial degree)&quot;, ylab=&quot;MSE&quot;) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend=c(&quot;MSE on original data&quot;, &quot;MSE on the whole range&quot;), lty=1:2, col=1:2, pch=1:2, bg=&quot;white&quot;) Figure 2.15: MSE on the dataset used to construct the model vs. MSE on a whole range of points as function of the polynomial degree Note the logarithmic scale on the \\(y\\) axis. This is a very typical behaviour! A model’s fit to observed data improves as the model’s complexity increases. A model’s generalisation to unseen data initially improves, but then becomes worse. In the above example, the sweet spot is at a polynomial of degree 3, which is exactly our true underlying model. Hence, most often we should be interested in the accuracy of the predictions made in the case of unobserved data. If we have a data set of a considerable size, we can divide it (randomly) into two parts: training sample (say, 60% or 80%) – used to fit a model test sample (the remaining 40% or 20%) – used to assess its quality (e.g., using MSE) More on this issue in the chapter on Classification. Remark. (*) We shall see that sometimes a train-test-validate split will be necessary, e.g., 60-20-20%. 2.4 Exercises in R 2.4.1 Anscombe’s Quartet Revisited Consider the anscombe database once again: print(anscombe) # `anscombe` is a built-in object ## x1 x2 x3 x4 y1 y2 y3 y4 ## 1 10 10 10 8 8.04 9.14 7.46 6.58 ## 2 8 8 8 8 6.95 8.14 6.77 5.76 ## 3 13 13 13 8 7.58 8.74 12.74 7.71 ## 4 9 9 9 8 8.81 8.77 7.11 8.84 ## 5 11 11 11 8 8.33 9.26 7.81 8.47 ## 6 14 14 14 8 9.96 8.10 8.84 7.04 ## 7 6 6 6 8 7.24 6.13 6.08 5.25 ## 8 4 4 4 19 4.26 3.10 5.39 12.50 ## 9 12 12 12 8 10.84 9.13 8.15 5.56 ## 10 7 7 7 8 4.82 7.26 6.42 7.91 ## 11 5 5 5 8 5.68 4.74 5.73 6.89 Recall that in the previous Chapter we have split the above data into four data frames ans1, …, ans4 with columns x and y.

Let’s plot the data set first, see Figure 2.18. ans3 &lt;- data.frame(x=anscombe$x3, y=anscombe$y3) plot(ans3$x, ans3$y) Figure 2.18: Scatter plot for ans3 Indeed, the observation at \\(x\\simeq 13\\) is an obvious outlier. Perhaps the easiest way to remove it is to call: ans3b &lt;- ans3[ans3$y&lt;=12,] # the outlier is definitely at y&gt;12 We could also use the condition y &lt; max(y), amongst others. Now let’s fit the linear model: f3b &lt;- lm(y~x, data=ans3b) plot(ans3b$x, ans3b$y) abline(f3b, col=&quot;red&quot;) Figure 2.19: Scatter plot for ans3 with the outlier removed and the fitted linear model Comment: Now Figure 2.19 is what we call linearly correlated data. By the way, Pearson’s coefficient now equals 1. 2.4.2 Countries of the World – Simple models involving the GDP per capita Let’s consider the World Factbook 2020 dataset (see this book’s datasets folder). It consists of country names, their population, area, GDP, mortality rates etc. We have scraped it from the CIA website at https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/rankorderguide.html and compiled into a single file on 3 April 2020. factbook &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/world_factbook_2020.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) Here is a preview of a few features for 3 selected countries (see help(\"%in%\")): factbook[factbook$country %in% c(&quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;New Zealand&quot;, &quot;United States&quot;), c(&quot;country&quot;, &quot;area&quot;, &quot;population&quot;, &quot;gdp_per_capita_ppp&quot;)] ## country area population gdp_per_capita_ppp ## 15 Australia 7741220 25466459 50400 ## 169 New Zealand 268838 4925477 39000 ## 247 United States 9833517 332639102 59800 Exercise. List the 10 countries with the highest GDP per capita. Click here for a solution. To recall, to generate a list of indexes that produce an ordered version of a numeric vector, we need to call the order() function. which_top &lt;- tail(order(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp, na.last=FALSE), 10) factbook[which_top, c(&quot;country&quot;, &quot;gdp_per_capita_ppp&quot;)] ## country gdp_per_capita_ppp ## 113 Ireland 73200 ## 35 Brunei 78900 ## 114 Isle of Man 84600 ## 211 Singapore 94100 ## 26 Bermuda 99400 ## 141 Luxembourg 105100 ## 157 Monaco 115700 ## 142 Macau 122000 ## 192 Qatar 124100 ## 139 Liechtenstein 139100 By the way, the reported values are in USD. Question: Which of these countries are tax havens? Exercise. Find the 5 most positively and the 5 most negatively correlated variables with the gdp_per_capita_ppp feature (of course, with respect to the Pearson coefficient). Click here for a solution. This can be solved via a call to cor(). Note that we need to make sure that missing vales are omitted from computations. A quick glimpse at the manual page (?cor) reveals that computing the correlation between a column and all the other ones (of course, except country, which is non-numeric) can be performed as follows. r &lt;- cor(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp, factbook[,!(names(factbook) %in% c(&quot;country&quot;, &quot;gdp_per_capita_ppp&quot;))], use=&quot;complete.obs&quot;)[1,] or &lt;- order(r) # ordering permutation (indexes) r[head(or, 5)] # first 5 ordered indexes ## infant_mortality_rate maternal_mortality_rate birth_rate ## -0.74658 -0.67005 -0.60822 ## death_rate total_fertility_rate ## -0.57216 -0.56725 r[tail(or, 5)] # last 5 ordered indexes ## natural_gas_production gross_national_saving ## 0.56898 0.61133 ## median_age obesity_adult_prevalence_rate ## 0.62090 0.63681 ## life_expectancy_at_birth ## 0.75461 Comment: “Live long and prosper” just gained a new meaning. Richer countries have lower infant and maternal mortality rates, lower birth rates, but higher life expectancy and obesity prevalence. Note, however, that correlation is not causation: we are unlikely to increase the GDP by asking people to put on weight. Exercise. Fit simple regression models where the per capita GDP explains its four most correlated variables (four individual models). Draw them on a scatter plot. Compute the root mean squared errors (RMSE), mean absolute errors (MAE) and the coefficients of determination (\\(R^2\\)). Click here for a solution. The four most correlated variables (we should look at the absolute value of the correlation coefficient now – recall that it is the correlation of 0 that means no linear dependence; 1 and -1 show a strong association between a pair of variables) are: (most_correlated &lt;- names(r)[tail(order(abs(r)), 4)]) ## [1] &quot;obesity_adult_prevalence_rate&quot; &quot;maternal_mortality_rate&quot; ## [3] &quot;infant_mortality_rate&quot; &quot;life_expectancy_at_birth&quot; We could take the above column names and construct four formulas manually, e.g., by writing gdp_per_capita_ppp~life_expectancy_at_birth, but we are lazy. Being lazy when it comes to computer programming is often a virtue, not a flaw in one’s character. Instead, we will run a for loop that extracts the pairs of interesting columns and constructs a formula based on two vectors (lm(Y~X)), see Figure 2.20. par(mfrow=c(2, 2)) # 4 plots on a 2x2 grid for (i in 1:4) { print(most_correlated[i]) X &lt;- factbook[,&quot;gdp_per_capita_ppp&quot;] Y &lt;- factbook[,most_correlated[i]] f &lt;- lm(Y~X) print(cbind(RMSE=sqrt(mean(f$residuals^2)), MAE=mean(abs(f$residuals)), R2=summary(f)$r.squared)) plot(X, Y, xlab=&quot;gdp_per_capita_ppp&quot;, ylab=most_correlated[i]) abline(f, col=&quot;red&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;obesity_adult_prevalence_rate&quot; ## RMSE MAE R2 ## [1,] 11.041 8.1589 0.062196 ## [1] &quot;maternal_mortality_rate&quot; ## RMSE MAE R2 ## [1,] 204.93 146.53 0.21481 ## [1] &quot;infant_mortality_rate&quot; ## RMSE MAE R2 ## [1,] 15.746 12.166 0.3005 ## [1] &quot;life_expectancy_at_birth&quot; ## RMSE MAE R2 ## [1,] 5.4292 4.3727 0.43096 Figure 2.20: A scatter plot matrix and regression lines for the 4 variables most correlated with the per capita GDP Recall that the root mean squared error is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squared residuals. Mean absolute error is the average of the absolute values of the residuals. The coefficient of determination is given by: \\(R^2(f) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(y_i-f(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot})\\right)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(y_i-\\bar{y}\\right)^2}\\). Comment: Unfortunately, we were misled by the high correlation coefficients between the \\(X\\)s and \\(Y\\)s: the low actual \\(R^2\\) scores indicate that these models should not be deemed trustworthy. Note that 3 of the plots are evidently L-shaped. Fun fact: (*) Interestingly, it can be shown that \\(R^2\\) (in the case of the linear models fitted by minimising the SSR) is the square of the correlation between the true \\(Y\\)s and the predicted \\(Y\\)s: X &lt;- factbook[,&quot;gdp_per_capita_ppp&quot;] Y &lt;- factbook[,most_correlated[i]] f &lt;- lm(Y~X, y=TRUE) print(summary(f)$r.squared) ## [1] 0.43096 print(cor(f$fitted.values, f$y)^2) ## [1] 0.43096 Side note: Do note that RMSE and MAE are interpretable: for instance, average error of life expectancy prediction based on the GDP is 4-5 years. Recall that you can find the information on the variables’ units of measure at https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/rankorderguide.html. 2.4.3 Countries of the World – Most correlated variables (*) Let’s get back to the World Factbook 2020 dataset (world_factbook_2020.csv). factbook &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/world_factbook_2020.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) Exercise. Create a data frame C with three columns named col1, col2 and r and \\(p(p-1)/2\\) rows, where \\(p\\) is the number of numeric features in factbook. Every row should represent a unique pair of column names in factbook (we do not distinguish between a,b and b,a) of correlation coefficients between them. Click here for a solution. First we will solve this exercise considering only 4 numeric features in our dataset, so that we can keep track of how the R expressions we evaluate actually work. Let us compute the Pearson coefficients between chosen pairs of variables. R &lt;- cor(factbook[,c(&quot;area&quot;, &quot;median_age&quot;, &quot;birth_rate&quot;, &quot;exports&quot;)], use=&quot;complete.obs&quot;) # 4 selected columns print(R) ## area median_age birth_rate exports ## area 1.000000 0.044524 -0.031995 0.49259 ## median_age 0.044524 1.000000 -0.921592 0.29973 ## birth_rate -0.031995 -0.921592 1.000000 -0.24296 ## exports 0.492586 0.299727 -0.242955 1.00000 Note that the R matrix has 1.0 on the diagonal (where each entry represents a correlation between a variable and itself). Moreover, it is symmetric around the diagonal – R[i,j] == R[j,i], because it is the correlation between the same pair of variables. Hence, from now on we may be interested in the elements below the diagonal. We can get access to them by using lower.tri() (“lower triangle”). R[lower.tri(R)] ## [1] 0.044524 -0.031995 0.492586 -0.921592 0.299727 -0.242955 This is already the 3rd column of the data frame we are asked to generate, which should look like: ## col1 col2 r ## 1 median_age area 0.044524 ## 2 birth_rate area -0.031995 ## 3 exports area 0.492586 ## 4 birth_rate median_age -0.921592 ## 5 exports median_age 0.299727 ## 6 exports birth_rate -0.242955 How the generate col1 and col2? One idea is to take the “lower triangles” of the following matrices: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] &quot;area&quot; &quot;area&quot; &quot;area&quot; &quot;area&quot; ## [2,] &quot;median_age&quot; &quot;median_age&quot; &quot;median_age&quot; &quot;median_age&quot; ## [3,] &quot;birth_rate&quot; &quot;birth_rate&quot; &quot;birth_rate&quot; &quot;birth_rate&quot; ## [4,] &quot;exports&quot; &quot;exports&quot; &quot;exports&quot; &quot;exports&quot; and: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] &quot;area&quot; &quot;median_age&quot; &quot;birth_rate&quot; &quot;exports&quot; ## [2,] &quot;area&quot; &quot;median_age&quot; &quot;birth_rate&quot; &quot;exports&quot; ## [3,] &quot;area&quot; &quot;median_age&quot; &quot;birth_rate&quot; &quot;exports&quot; ## [4,] &quot;area&quot; &quot;median_age&quot; &quot;birth_rate&quot; &quot;exports&quot; Here is a complete solution for all the features is factbook: R &lt;- cor(factbook[,-1], use=&quot;complete.obs&quot;) # skip the `country` column rrr &lt;- matrix(dimnames(R)[[1]], nrow=nrow(R), ncol=ncol(R)) ccc &lt;- matrix(dimnames(R)[[2]], byrow=TRUE, nrow=nrow(R), ncol=ncol(R)) C &lt;- data.frame(col1=rrr[lower.tri(rrr)], col2=ccc[lower.tri(ccc)], r=R[lower.tri(R)]) Comment: In “classical” programming languages we would perhaps have used of a double (nested) for loop here (a less readable solution). Exercise. Find the 5 most correlated pairs of variables. Click here for a solution. This can be done by ordering the rows of C in decreasing order of absolute values of C$r, and then choosing the first 5 rows. C_top &lt;- head(C[order(abs(C$r), decreasing=TRUE),], 5) knitr::kable(C_top) col1 col2 r 1687 electricity_installed_generating_capacity electricity_production 0.99942 1684 electricity_consumption electricity_production 0.99921 88 labor_force population 0.99862 1718 electricity_installed_generating_capacity electricity_consumption 0.99815 1300 telephones_mobile_cellular labor_force 0.99793 Comment: The most correlated pairs of features are not really “mind-blowing”… Exercise. Fit simple regression models for the most correlated pair of variables. Click here for a solution. There is a degree of ambiguity here: should col1 or rather col2 be treated as the dependent variable in our model? Let’s do it either way. To learn something new, which is exactly why we are all here, we will create the formulas programmatically, by first concatenating (joining) appropriate strings (note that in order to input a double quotes character, we need to proceed in with a backslash), and then calling the formula() function. form &lt;- formula(paste(C_top[1,2], &quot;~&quot;, C_top[1,1])) f &lt;- lm(form, data=factbook) print(f) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = form, data = factbook) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) ## 7.95e+08 ## electricity_installed_generating_capacity ## 3.63e+03 plot(factbook[,C_top[1,1]], factbook[,C_top[1,2]], xlab=C_top[1,1], ylab=C_top[1,2]) abline(f, col=&quot;red&quot;) Figure 2.21: Most correlated pair of variables and the invisible regression line Figure 2.21 depicts the fitted model. 2.4.4 Countries of the World – A non-linear model based on the GDP per capita Let’s revisit the World Factbook 2020 dataset (world_factbook_2020.csv). factbook &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/world_factbook_2020.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) Exercise. Draw a histogram of the empirical distribution of the GDP per capita. Moreover, draw a histogram of the logarithm of the GDP/person. Click here for a solution. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) hist(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp, col=&quot;white&quot;, main=NA) hist(log(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp), col=&quot;white&quot;, main=NA) Figure 2.22: Histograms of the empirical distribution of the GDP per capita with linear (left) and log (right) scale on the X axis Comment: In Figure 2.22 we see that distribution of the GDP is right-skewed: most countries have small GDP. However, few of them (those in the “right tail” of the distribution) are very very rich (hey, how about taxing the richest countries?!). There is the famous observation made by V. Pareto stating that most assets are in the hands of the “wealthy minority” (compare: power law, rich-get-richer rule, preferential attachment in complex networks). Interestingly, many real-world-phenomena are distributed similarly (e.g., the popularity of web pages, the number of followers of Instagram profiles). It is frequently the case that the logarithm of the aforementioned variable looks more “normal” (is bell-shaped). Side note: “The” logarithm most often refers to the logarithm base \\(e\\), \\(\\log x = \\log_e x\\), where \\(e\\simeq 2.72\\) is the Euler constant, see exp(1) in R. Note that you can only compute logarithms of positive real numbers. Non-technical audience might be confused when asked to contemplate the distribution of the logarithm of a variable. Let’s make it more user-friendly (on the other hand, we could’ve asked them to harden up…) by nicely re-labelling the X axis, see Figure 2.23. hist(log(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp), axes=FALSE, xlab=&quot;GDP per capita (thousands USD)&quot;, main=NA, col=&quot;white&quot;) box() axis(2) # Y axis at &lt;- c(1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000, 200000) axis(1, at=log(at), labels=at/1000) Figure 2.23: Histogram of the empirical distribution of the GDP per capita now with human-readable X axis labels (not the logarithmic scale) Comment: This is still a plot of the logarithm of the distribution of the per capita GDP, but it’s somehow “hidden” behind the human-readable axis labels. Nice. Exercise. Fit a simple linear model of life_expectancy_at_birth as a function of gdp_per_capita_ppp. Click here for a solution. Easy. We have already done than in one of the previous exercises. Yet, to learn something new, let’s note that the plot() function accepts formulas as well. f &lt;- lm(life_expectancy_at_birth~gdp_per_capita_ppp, data=factbook) plot(life_expectancy_at_birth~gdp_per_capita_ppp, data=factbook) abline(f, col=&quot;purple&quot;) summary(f)$r.squared ## [1] 0.43096 Figure 2.24: Linear model fitted for life expectancy vs. GDP/person Comment: From Figure 2.24 we see that this is not a good model. Exercise. Draw a scatter plot of life_expectancy_at_birth as a function gdp_per_capita_ppp, with the X axis being logarithmic. Compute the correlation coefficient between log(gdp_per_capita_ppp) and life_expectancy_at_birth. Click here for a solution. We could apply the log()-transformation manually and generate fancy X axis labels ourselves. However, the plot() function has the log argument (see ?plot.default) which provides us with all we need, see Figure 2.25. plot(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp, factbook$life_expectancy_at_birth, log=&quot;x&quot;) Figure 2.25: Scatter plot of life expectancy vs. GDP/person with log scale on the X axis Here is the linear correlation coefficient between the logarithm of the GDP/person and the life expectancy. cor(log(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp), factbook$life_expectancy_at_birth, use=&quot;complete.obs&quot;) ## [1] 0.80665 The correlation is quite high, hence the following task. Exercise. Fit a model predicting life_expectancy_at_birth by means of log(gdp_per_capita_ppp). Click here for a solution. We would like to fit a model of the form \\(Y=a\\log X+b\\). The formula life_expectancy_at_birth~log(gdp_per_capita_ppp) should do the trick here. f &lt;- lm(life_expectancy_at_birth~log(gdp_per_capita_ppp), data=factbook) plot(life_expectancy_at_birth~log(gdp_per_capita_ppp), data=factbook) abline(f, col=&quot;red&quot;, lty=3) f$coefficients ## (Intercept) log(gdp_per_capita_ppp) ## 28.3064 4.8178 summary(f)$r.squared ## [1] 0.65069 Figure 2.26: Linear model fitted for life expectancy vs. the logarithm of GDP/person Comment: That is an okay model (in terms of the coefficient of determination), see Figure 2.26. Exercise. Draw the fitted logarithmic model on a scatter plot with a standard, non-logarithmic X axis. Click here for a solution. The model fitted above is of the form \\(Y\\simeq4.82 \\log X+28.31\\). To depict it on a plot with linear (non-logarithmic) axes, we can compute this formula on multiple points by hand, see Figure 2.27. plot(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp, factbook$life_expectancy_at_birth) # many points on the X axis: xxx &lt;- seq(min(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp, na.rm=TRUE), max(factbook$gdp_per_capita_ppp, na.rm=TRUE), length.out=101) yyy &lt;- f$coefficients[1] + f$coefficients[2]*log(xxx) lines(xxx, yyy, col=&quot;red&quot;, lty=3) Figure 2.27: Logarithmic model fitted for life expectancy vs. GDP/person Comment: Well, people are not immortal… The original (linear) model didn’t really take that into account. Also, recall that correlation is not causation. Moreover, there is a lot of variability at an individual level. Being born in a less-wealthy country (e.g., not in a tax haven), doesn’t mean you don’t have the whole life ahead of you. Do the cool staff, do something for the others. Life’s not about money. 2.4.5 Countries of the World – A multiple regression model for the per capita GDP Let’s play with World Factbook 2020 (world_factbook_2020.csv) once again. World is an interesting place, so we’re far from being bored with this dataset. factbook &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/world_factbook_2020.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) Let’s restrict ourselves to the following columns, mostly related to imports and exports: factbookn &lt;- factbook[c(&quot;gdp_purchasing_power_parity&quot;, &quot;imports&quot;, &quot;exports&quot;, &quot;electricity_exports&quot;, &quot;electricity_imports&quot;, &quot;military_expenditures&quot;, &quot;crude_oil_exports&quot;, &quot;crude_oil_imports&quot;, &quot;natural_gas_exports&quot;, &quot;natural_gas_imports&quot;, &quot;reserves_of_foreign_exchange_and_gold&quot;)] Let’s compute the per capita versions of the above, by dividing all values by each country’s population: for (i in 1:ncol(factbookn)) factbookn[[i]] &lt;- factbookn[[i]]/factbook$population We are going to build a few multiple regression models using the step() function, which is not too fond of missing values, therefore they should be removed first: factbookn &lt;- na.omit(factbookn) c(nrow(factbook), nrow(factbookn)) # how many countries were omitted? ## [1] 261 157 Exercise. Build a model for gdp_purchasing_power_parity as a function of imports and exports (all per capita). Click here for a solution. Let’s first take a look at how the aforementioned variables are related to each other, see Figure 2.28. pairs(factbookn[c(&quot;gdp_purchasing_power_parity&quot;, &quot;imports&quot;, &quot;exports&quot;)]) cor(factbookn[c(&quot;gdp_purchasing_power_parity&quot;, &quot;imports&quot;, &quot;exports&quot;)]) ## gdp_purchasing_power_parity imports exports ## gdp_purchasing_power_parity 1.00000 0.82891 0.81899 ## imports 0.82891 1.00000 0.94241 ## exports 0.81899 0.94241 1.00000 Figure 2.28: Scatter plot matrix for GDP, imports and exports They are nicely correlated. Moreover, they are on a similar scale (“tens of thousands of USD per capita”). Fitting the requested model yields: options(scipen=10) # prefer &quot;decimal&quot; over &quot;scientific&quot; notation f1 &lt;- lm(gdp_purchasing_power_parity~imports+exports, data=factbookn) f1$coefficients ## (Intercept) imports exports ## 9852.53813 1.44194 0.78067 summary(f1)$adj.r.squared ## [1] 0.69598 Exercise.

However, the model is not perfect, so we should refrain ourselves from building a brand new economic theory around this “discovery”. On the other hand, you know what they say: all models are wrong, but some might be useful. Note that we used the adjusted \\(R^2\\) coefficient to correct for the number of variables in the model so as to make it more comparable with the coefficient corresponding to the f1 model. Exercise.

Linear models go beyond fitting of straight lines and other hyperplanes! A complex model may overfit and hence generalise poorly to unobserved inputs. Note that the SSR criterion makes the models sensitive to outliers. Remember: good models \\[=\\] better understanding of the modelled reality \\(+\\) better predictions \\[=\\] more revenue, your boss’ happiness, your startup’s growth etc. 2.5.2 Other Methods for Regression Other example approaches to regression: ridge regression, lasso regression, least absolute deviations (LAD) regression, multiadaptive regression splines (MARS), K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) regression, see FNN::knn.reg() in R, regression trees, support-vector regression (SVR), neural networks (also deep) for regression. 2.5.3 Derivation of the Solution (**) We would like to find an analytical solution to the problem of minimising of the sum of squared residuals: \\[ \\min_{\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\dots, \\beta_p\\in\\mathbb{R}} E(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p)= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)^2 \\] This requires computing the \\(p+1\\) partial derivatives \\({\\partial E}/{\\partial \\beta_j}\\) for \\(j=0,\\dots,p\\). The partial derivatives are very similar to each other; \\(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_0}\\) is given by: \\[ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_0}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)= 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right) \\] and \\(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_j}\\) for \\(j&gt;0\\) is equal to: \\[ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_j}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)= 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,j} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right) \\] Then all we need to do is to solve the system of linear equations: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_0}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_1}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_p}(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] The above system of \\(p+1\\) linear equations, which we are supposed to solve for \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p\\): \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}}\\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] can be rewritten as: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}}\\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}\\right)&amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} y_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}\\right)&amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} y_i \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}\\right)&amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} y_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] and further as: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\beta_0\\ n\\phantom{\\sum_{i=1}^n x} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n\\phantom{x_{i,0}} y_i \\\\ \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} y_i \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} y_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Note that the terms involving \\(x_{i,j}\\) and \\(y_i\\) (the sums) are all constant – these are some fixed real numbers. We have learned how to solve such problems in high school. Exercise. Try deriving the analytical solution and implementing it for \\(p=2\\). Recall that in the previous chapter we solved the special case of \\(p=1\\). 2.5.4 Solution in Matrix Form (***) Assume that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) (a matrix with inputs), \\(\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times 1}\\) (a column vector of reference outputs) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(p+1)\\times 1}\\) (a column vector of parameters). Firstly, note that a linear model of the form: \\[ f_{\\boldsymbol\\beta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1+\\dots+\\beta_p x_p \\] can be rewritten as: \\[ f_{\\boldsymbol\\beta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\beta_0 1+\\beta_1 x_1+\\dots+\\beta_p x_p =\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}\\boldsymbol\\beta, \\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}=[1\\ x_1\\ x_2\\ \\cdots\\ x_p]\\). Similarly, if we assume that \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{X}}=[\\boldsymbol{1}\\ \\mathbf{X}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times (p+1)}\\) is the input matrix with a prepended column of \\(1\\)s, i.e., \\(\\boldsymbol{1}=[1\\ 1\\ \\cdots\\ 1]^T\\) and \\(\\dot{x}_{i,0}=1\\) (for brevity of notation the columns added will have index \\(0\\)), \\(\\dot{x}_{i,j}=x_{i,j}\\) for all \\(j\\ge 1\\) and all \\(i\\), then: \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\boldsymbol\\beta \\] gives the vector of predicted outputs for every input point. This way, the sum of squared residuals \\[ E(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p)= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_{i} \\right)^2 \\] can be rewritten as: \\[ E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)=\\| \\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\boldsymbol\\beta - \\mathbf{y} \\|^2, \\] where as usual \\(\\|\\cdot\\|^2\\) denotes the squared Euclidean norm. Recall that this can be re-expressed as: \\[ E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)= (\\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\boldsymbol\\beta - \\mathbf{y})^T (\\mathbf{\\dot{X}} \\boldsymbol\\beta - \\mathbf{y}). \\] In order to find the minimum of \\(E\\) w.r.t. \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\), we need to find the parameters that make the partial derivatives vanish, i.e.: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_0}(\\boldsymbol\\beta)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_1}(\\boldsymbol\\beta)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_p}(\\boldsymbol\\beta)&amp;=&amp;0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Remark. (***) Interestingly, the above can also be expressed in matrix form, using the special notation: \\[ \\nabla E(\\boldsymbol\\beta) = \\boldsymbol{0} \\] Here, \\(\\nabla E\\) (nabla symbol = differential operator) denotes the function gradient, i.e., the vector of all partial derivatives. This is nothing more than syntactic sugar for this quite commonly applied operator. Anyway, the system of linear equations we have derived above: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\beta_0\\ n\\phantom{\\sum_{i=1}^n x} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phantom{x_{i,0}} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n\\phantom{x_{i,0}} y_i \\\\ \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,1} y_i \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} + \\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} x_{i,p} &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,p} y_i \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] can be rewritten in matrix terms as: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\beta_0 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0} + \\beta_1 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\beta_0 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0} + \\beta_1 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\beta_0 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0} + \\beta_1 \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p} &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{y}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] This can be restated as: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\right)\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,0}^T \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\right)\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,1}^T \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\right)\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta &amp;=&amp; \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{\\cdot,p}^T \\mathbf{y}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] which in turn is equivalent to: \\[ \\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{X}}^T\\mathbf{X}\\right)\\,\\boldsymbol\\beta = \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}^T\\mathbf{y}. \\] Such a system of linear equations in matrix form can be solved numerically using, amongst others, the solve() function. Remark. (***) In practice, we’d rather rely on QR or SVD decompositions of matrices for efficiency and numerical accuracy reasons. Numeric example – solution via lm(): X1 &lt;- as.numeric(Credit$Balance[Credit$Balance&gt;0]) X2 &lt;- as.numeric(Credit$Income[Credit$Balance&gt;0]) Y &lt;- as.numeric(Credit$Rating[Credit$Balance&gt;0]) lm(Y~X1+X2)$coefficients ## (Intercept) X1 X2 ## 172.5587 0.1828 2.1976 Recalling that \\(\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{B}\\) can be computed by calling t(A) %*% B or – even faster – by calling crossprod(A, B), we can also use solve() to obtain the same result: X_dot &lt;- cbind(1, X1, X2) solve( crossprod(X_dot, X_dot), crossprod(X_dot, Y) ) ## [,1] ## 172.5587 ## X1 0.1828 ## X2 2.1976 2.5.5 Pearson’s r in Matrix Form (**) Recall the Pearson linear correlation coefficient: \\[ r(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x}) (y_i-\\bar{y}) }{ \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\ \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\bar{y})^2} } \\] Denote with \\(\\boldsymbol{x}^\\circ\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}^\\circ\\) the centred versions of \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\), respectively, i.e., \\(x_i^\\circ=x_i-\\bar{x}\\) and \\(y_i^\\circ=y_i-\\bar{y}\\). Rewriting the above yields: \\[ r(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^\\circ y_i^\\circ }{ \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n ({x_i^\\circ})^2}\\ \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n ({y_i^\\circ})^2} } \\] which is exactly: \\[ r(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) = \\frac{ \\boldsymbol{x}^\\circ\\cdot \\boldsymbol{y}^\\circ }{ \\| \\boldsymbol{x}^\\circ \\|\\ \\| \\boldsymbol{y}^\\circ \\| } \\] i.e., the normalised dot product of the centred versions of the two vectors. This is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors (in \\(n\\)-dimensional spaces)! (**) Recalling from the previous chapter that \\(\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{A}\\) gives the dot product between all the pairs of columns in a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), we can implement an equivalent version of cor(C) as follows: C &lt;- Credit[Credit$Balance&gt;0, c(&quot;Rating&quot;, &quot;Limit&quot;, &quot;Income&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;, &quot;Balance&quot;)] C_centred &lt;- apply(C, 2, function(c) c-mean(c)) C_normalised &lt;- apply(C_centred, 2, function(c) c/sqrt(sum(c^2))) round(t(C_normalised) %*% C_normalised, 3) ## Rating Limit Income Age Education Balance ## Rating 1.000 0.996 0.831 0.167 -0.040 0.798 ## Limit 0.996 1.000 0.834 0.164 -0.032 0.796 ## Income 0.831 0.834 1.000 0.227 -0.033 0.414 ## Age 0.167 0.164 0.227 1.000 0.024 0.008 ## Education -0.040 -0.032 -0.033 0.024 1.000 0.001 ## Balance 0.798 0.796 0.414 0.008 0.001 1.000 2.5.6 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (James et al. 2017: Chapters 1, 2 and 3) Other: (Hastie et al. 2017: Chapter 1, Sections 3.2 and 3.3) References "],

I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. 3.1 Introduction 3.1.1 Classification Task Let \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) be an input matrix that consists of \\(n\\) points in a \\(p\\)-dimensional space (each of the \\(n\\) objects is described by means of \\(p\\) numerical features). Recall that in supervised learning, with each \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) we associate the desired output \\(y_i\\). \\[ \\mathbf{X}= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} \\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\qquad \\mathbf{y} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} {y}_{1} \\\\ {y}_{2} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ {y}_{n} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] In this chapter we are interested in classification tasks; we assume that each \\(y_i\\) is a label (e.g., a character string) – it is of quantitative/categorical type. Most commonly, we are faced with binary classification tasks where there are only two possible distinct labels. We traditionally denote them with \\(0\\)s and \\(1\\)s. For example: 0 1 no yes false true failure success healthy ill On the other hand, in multiclass classification, we assume that each \\(y_i\\) takes more than two possible values. Example plot of a synthetic dataset with the reference binary \\(y\\)s is given in Figure 3.1. The “true” decision boundary is at \\(X_1=0\\) but the classes slightly overlap (the dataset is a bit noisy). Figure 3.1: A synthetic 2D dataset with the true decision boundary at \\(X_1=0\\) 3.1.2 Data For illustration, let’s consider the Wine Quality dataset (Cortez et al. 2009) that can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) – white wines only. wines &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/winequality-all.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) wines &lt;- wines[wines$color == &quot;white&quot;,] (n &lt;- nrow(wines)) # number of samples ## [1] 4898 These are Vinho Verde wine samples from the north of Portugal, see https://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/homepage. There are 11 physicochemical features reported. Moreover, there is a wine rating (which we won’t consider here) on the scale 0 (bad) to 10 (excellent) given by wine experts. The input matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) consists of the first 10 numeric variables: X &lt;- as.matrix(wines[,1:10]) dim(X) ## [1] 4898 10 head(X, 2) # first two rows ## fixed.acidity volatile.acidity citric.acid residual.sugar ## 1600 7.0 0.27 0.36 20.7 ## 1601 6.3 0.30 0.34 1.6 ## chlorides free.sulfur.dioxide total.sulfur.dioxide density pH ## 1600 0.045 45 170 1.001 3.0 ## 1601 0.049 14 132 0.994 3.3 ## sulphates ## 1600 0.45 ## 1601 0.49 The 11th variable measures the amount of alcohol (in %). We will convert this dependent variable to a binary one: 0 == (alcohol &lt; 12) == lower-alcohol wines1 1 == (alcohol &gt;= 12) == higher-alcohol wines # recall that TRUE == 1 Y &lt;- factor(as.character(as.numeric(wines$alcohol &gt;= 12))) table(Y) ## Y ## 0 1 ## 4085 813 Now \\((\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})\\) is a basis for an interesting (yet challenging) binary classification task. 3.1.3 Training and Test Sets Recall that we are genuinely interested in the construction of supervised learning models for the two following purposes: description – to explain a given dataset in simpler terms, prediction – to forecast the values of the dependent variable for inputs that are yet to be observed. In the latter case: we don’t want our models to overfit to current data, we want our models to generalise well to new data. One way to assess if a model has sufficient predictive power is based on a random train-test split of the original dataset: training sample (usually 60-80% of the observations) – used to construct a model, test sample (remaining 40-20%) – used to assess the goodness of fit. Remark. Test sample must not be used in the training phase! (No cheating!) 60/40% train-test split in R: set.seed(123) # reproducibility matters random_indices &lt;- sample(n) head(random_indices) # preview ## [1] 2463 2511 2227 526 4291 2986 # first 60% of the indices (they are arranged randomly) # will constitute the train sample: train_indices &lt;- random_indices[1:floor(n*0.6)] X_train &lt;- X[train_indices,] Y_train &lt;- Y[train_indices] # the remaining indices (40%) go to the test sample: X_test &lt;- X[-train_indices,] Y_test &lt;- Y[-train_indices] 3.1.4 Discussed Methods Our aim is to build a classifier that takes 10 wine physicochemical features and determines whether it’s a “strong” wine. We will discuss 3 simple and educational (yet practically useful) classification algorithms: K-nearest neighbour scheme – this chapter, Decision trees – the next chapter, Logistic regression – the next chapter. 3.2 K-nearest Neighbour Classifier 3.2.1 Introduction Rule. “If you don’t know what to do in a situation, just act like the people around you” For some integer \\(K\\ge 1\\), the K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) Classifier proceeds as follows. To classify a new point \\(\\mathbf{x}&#39;\\): find the \\(K\\) nearest neighbours of a given point \\(\\mathbf{x}&#39;\\) amongst the points in the train set, denoted \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i_1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_{i_K,\\cdot}\\): compute the Euclidean distances between \\(\\mathbf{x}&#39;\\) and each \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) from the train set, \\[d_i = \\|\\mathbf{x}&#39;-\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\|\\] order \\(d_i\\)s in increasing order, \\(d_{i_1} \\le d_{i_2} \\le \\dots \\le d_{i_K}\\) pick first \\(K\\) indices (these are the nearest neighbours) fetch the corresponding reference labels \\(y_{i_1}, \\dots, y_{i_K}\\) return their mode as a result, i.e., the most frequently occurring label (a.k.a. majority vote) Here is how \\(K\\)-NN classifier works on a synthetic 2D dataset. Firstly let’s consider \\(K=1\\), see Figure 3.2. Gray and pink regions depict how new points would be classified. In particular 1-NN is “greedy” in the sense that we just locate the nearest point. Figure 3.2: 1-NN class bounds for our 2D synthetic dataset Remark. (*) 1-NN classification is essentially based on a dataset’s so-called Voronoi diagram. Increasing \\(K\\) somehow smoothens the decision boundary (this makes it less “local” and more “global”). Figure 3.3 depicts the \\(K=3\\) case. Figure 3.3: 3-NN class bounds for our 2D synthetic dataset Figure 3.4: 25-NN class bounds for our 2D synthetic dataset Recall that the “true” decision boundary for this synthetic dataset is at \\(X_1=0\\). The 25-NN classifier did quite a good job, see Figure 3.4. 3.2.2 Example in R We shall be calling the knn() function from package FNN to classify the points from the test sample extracted from the wines dataset: library(&quot;FNN&quot;) Let’s make prediction using the 5-nn classifier: Y_knn5 &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5) head(Y_test, 28) # True Ys ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Levels: 0 1 head(Y_knn5, 28) # Predicted Ys ## [1] 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Levels: 0 1 mean(Y_test == Y_knn5) # accuracy ## [1] 0.81735 9-nn classifier: Y_knn9 &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=9) head(Y_test, 28) # True Ys ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Levels: 0 1 head(Y_knn9, 28) # Predicted Ys ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Levels: 0 1 mean(Y_test == Y_knn9) # accuracy ## [1] 0.81939 3.2.3 Feature Engineering Note that the Euclidean distance that we used above implicitly assumes that every feature (independent variable) is on the same scale. However, when dealing with, e.g., physical quantities, we often perform conversions of units of measurement (kg → g, feet → m etc.). Transforming a single feature may drastically change the metric structure of the dataset and therefore highly affect the obtained predictions. To “bring data to the same scale”, we often apply a trick called standardisation. Computing the so-called Z-scores of the \\(j\\)-th feature, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\cdot,j}\\), is done by subtracting from each observation the sample mean and dividing the result by the sample standard deviation: \\[z_{i,j} = \\frac{x_{i,j}-\\bar{x}_{\\cdot,j}}{s_{x_{\\cdot,j}}}\\] This a new feature \\(\\mathbf{z}_{\\cdot,j}\\) that always has mean 0 and standard deviation of 1. Moreover, it is unit-less (e.g., we divide a value in kgs by a value in kgs, the units are cancelled out). This, amongst others, prevents one of the features from dominating the other ones. Z-scores are easy to interpret, e.g., 0.5 denotes an observation that is 0.5 standard deviations above the mean and -3 informs us that a value is 3 standard deviations below the mean. Remark. (*) If data are normally distributed (bell-shaped histogram), with very high probability, most (expected value is 99.74%) observations should have Z-scores between -3 and 3. Those that don’t, are “suspicious”, maybe they are outliers? We should inspect them manually. Let’s compute Z_train and Z_test, being the standardised versions of X_train and X_test, respectively. means &lt;- apply(X_train, 2, mean) # column means sds &lt;- apply(X_train, 2, sd) # column standard deviations Z_train &lt;- X_train # copy Z_test &lt;- X_test # copy for (j in 1:ncol(X)) { Z_train[,j] &lt;- (Z_train[,j]-means[j])/sds[j] Z_test[,j] &lt;- (Z_test[,j] -means[j])/sds[j] } Note that we have transformed the training and test sample in the very same way. Computing means and standard deviations separately for these two datasets is a common error – it is the training set that we use in the course of the learning process. The above can be re-written as: Z_train &lt;- t(apply(X_train, 1, function(r) (r-means)/sds)) Z_test &lt;- t(apply(X_test, 1, function(r) (r-means)/sds)) See Figure 3.5 for an illustration. Note that the righthand figures (histograms of standardised variables) are on the same scale now. Figure 3.5: Empirical distribution of two variables (pH on the top, fixed.acidity on the bottom) before (left) and after (right) standardising Remark. Of course, standardisation is only about shifting and scaling, it preserves the shape of the distribution. If the original variable is right skewed or bimodal, its standardised version will remain as such. Let’s compute the accuracy of K-NN classifiers acting on standardised data. Y_knn5s &lt;- knn(Z_train, Z_test, Y_train, k=5) mean(Y_test == Y_knn5s) # accuracy ## [1] 0.91429 Y_knn9s &lt;- knn(Z_train, Z_test, Y_train, k=9) mean(Y_test == Y_knn9s) # accuracy ## [1] 0.91378 The accuracy is much better. Standardisation is an example of feature engineering. Good models rarely work well “straight out of the box” – if that was the case, we wouldn’t need data scientists and machine learning engineers! To increase models’ accuracy, we often spend a lot of time: cleansing data (e.g., removing outliers) extracting new features transforming existing features trying to find a set of features that are relevant This is the “more art than science” part of data science (sic!), and hence most textbooks are not really eager for discussing such topics (including this one). Sorry, this is sad but true. The solutions that work well in the case of dataset A may fail in the B case and vice versa. However, the more exercises you solve, the greater the arsenal of ideas/possible approaches you will have at hand when dealing with real-world problems. Feature selection – example (manually selected columns): features &lt;- c(&quot;density&quot;, &quot;residual.sugar&quot;) Y_knn5s &lt;- knn(Z_train[,features], Z_test[,features], Y_train, k=5) mean(Y_test == Y_knn5s) # accuracy ## [1] 0.91633 Y_knn9s &lt;- knn(Z_train[,features], Z_test[,features], Y_train, k=9) mean(Y_test == Y_knn9s) # accuracy ## [1] 0.925 Exercise. Try to find a combination of 2-4 features (by guessing or applying magic tricks) that increases the accuracy of a \\(K\\)-NN classifier on this dataset. 3.3 Model Assessment and Selection 3.3.1 Performance Metrics Recall that \\(y_i\\) denotes the true label associated with the \\(i\\)-th observation. Let \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) denote the classifier’s output for a given \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\). Ideally, we’d wish that \\(\\hat{y}_i=y_i\\). Sadly, in practice we will make errors. Here are the 4 possible situations (true vs. predicted label): . \\(y_i=0\\) \\(y_i=1\\) \\(\\hat{y}_i=0\\) True Negative False Negative (Type II error) \\(\\hat{y}_i=1\\) False Positive (Type I error) True Positive Note that the terms positive and negative refer to the classifier’s output, i.e., occur when \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is equal to \\(1\\) and \\(0\\), respectively. A confusion matrix is used to summarise the correctness of predictions for the whole sample: Y_pred &lt;- knn(Z_train, Z_test, Y_train, k=9) (C &lt;- table(Y_pred, Y_test)) ## Y_test ## Y_pred 0 1 ## 0 1607 133 ## 1 36 184 For example, C[1,1] # number of TNs ## [1] 1607 C[2,1] # number of FPs ## [1] 36 Accuracy is the ratio of the correctly classified instances to all the instances. In other words, it is the probability of making a correct prediction. \\[ \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{TP}+\\text{TN}}{\\text{TP}+\\text{TN}+\\text{FP}+\\text{FN}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{I}\\left( y_i = \\hat{y}_i \\right) \\] where \\(\\mathbb{I}\\) is the indicator function, \\(\\mathbb{I}(l)=1\\) if logical condition \\(l\\) is true and \\(0\\) otherwise. mean(Y_test == Y_pred) # accuracy ## [1] 0.91378 (C[1,1]+C[2,2])/sum(C) # equivalently ## [1] 0.91378 In many applications we are dealing with unbalanced problems, where the case \\(y_i=1\\) is relatively rare, yet predicting it correctly is much more important than being accurate with respect to class \\(0\\). Remark. Think of medical applications, e.g., HIV testing or tumour diagnosis. In such a case, accuracy as a metric fails to quantify what we are aiming for. Remark. If only 1% of the cases have true \\(y_i=1\\), then a dummy classifier that always outputs \\(\\hat{y}_i=0\\) has 99% accuracy. Metrics such as precision and recall (and their aggregated version, F-measure) aim to address this problem. Precision \\[ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP}+\\text{FP}} \\] If the classifier outputs \\(1\\), what is the probability that this is indeed true? C[2,2]/(C[2,2]+C[2,1]) # Precision ## [1] 0.83636 Recall (a.k.a. sensitivity, hit rate or true positive rate) \\[ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP}+\\text{FN}} \\] If the true class is \\(1\\), what is the probability that the classifier will detect it? C[2,2]/(C[2,2]+C[1,2]) # Recall ## [1] 0.58044 Remark. Precision or recall? It depends on an application. Think of medical diagnosis, medical screening, plagiarism detection, etc. — which measure is more important in each of the settings listed? As a compromise, we can use the F-measure (a.k.a. \\(F_1\\)-measure), which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: \\[ \\text{F} = \\frac{1}{ \\frac{ \\frac{1}{\\text{Precision}}+\\frac{1}{\\text{Recall}} }{2} } = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\text{Precision}^{-1}+\\text{Recall}^{-1} \\right) \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\frac{\\text{FP} + \\text{FN}}{2}} \\] Exercise. Show that the above equality holds.

We haven’t yet considered the question which \\(K\\) yields the best classifier. Best == one that has the highest predictive power. Best == with respect to some chosen metric (accuracy, recall, precision, F-measure, …) Let’s study how the metrics on the test set change as functions of the number of nearest neighbours considered, \\(K\\). Auxiliary function: knn_metrics &lt;- function(k, X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test) { Y_pred &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=k) # classify get_metrics(Y_pred, Y_test) } For example: knn_metrics(5, Z_train, Z_test, Y_train, Y_test) ## Acc Prec Rec F TN FN ## 0.91429 0.82251 0.59937 0.69343 1602.00000 127.00000 ## FP TP ## 41.00000 190.00000 Example call to evaluate metrics as a function of different \\(K\\)s: Ks &lt;- seq(1, 19, by=2) Ps &lt;- as.data.frame(t( sapply(Ks, # on each element in this vector knn_metrics, # apply this function Z_train, Z_test, Y_train, Y_test # aux args ))) Remark. Note that sapply(X, f, arg1, arg2, ...) outputs a list Y such that Y[[i]] = f(X[i], arg1, arg2, ...) which is then simplified to a matrix. Remark. We transpose this result, t(), in order to get each metric corresponding to different columns in the result. As usual, if you keep wondering, e.g., why t(), play with the code yourself – it’s fun fun fun. Example results: round(cbind(K=Ks, Ps), 2) ## K Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP ## 1 1 0.92 0.77 0.72 0.74 1574 90 69 227 ## 2 3 0.92 0.79 0.66 0.72 1587 108 56 209 ## 3 5 0.91 0.82 0.60 0.69 1602 127 41 190 ## 4 7 0.91 0.82 0.56 0.67 1604 138 39 179 ## 5 9 0.91 0.84 0.58 0.69 1607 133 36 184 ## 6 11 0.91 0.85 0.56 0.68 1611 138 32 179 ## 7 13 0.91 0.83 0.57 0.68 1606 136 37 181 ## 8 15 0.91 0.83 0.55 0.66 1607 144 36 173 ## 9 17 0.91 0.82 0.53 0.64 1607 149 36 168 ## 10 19 0.90 0.81 0.52 0.63 1603 151 40 166 Figure 3.6 is worth a thousand tables though (see ?matplot in R). The reader is kindly asked to draw conclusions themself. Figure 3.6: Performance of \\(K\\)-nn classifiers as a function of \\(K\\) for standardised and raw data 3.3.3 Training, Validation and Test sets In the \\(K\\)-NN classification task, there are many hyperparameters to tune up: Which \\(K\\) should we choose? Should we standardise the dataset? Which variables should be taken into account when computing the Euclidean distance? Remark. If we select the best hyperparameter set based on test sample error, we will run into the trap of overfitting again. This time we’ll be overfitting to the test set — the model that is optimal for a given test sample doesn’t have to generalise well to other test samples (!). In order to overcome this problem, we can perform a random train-validation-test split of the original dataset: training sample (e.g., 60%) – used to construct the models validation sample (e.g., 20%) – used to tune the hyperparameters of the classifier test sample (e.g., 20%) – used to assess the goodness of fit An example way to perform a 60/20/20% train-validation-test split: set.seed(123) # reproducibility matters random_indices &lt;- sample(n) n1 &lt;- floor(n*0.6) n2 &lt;- floor(n*0.8) X2_train &lt;- X[random_indices[1 :n1], ] Y2_train &lt;- Y[random_indices[1 :n1] ] X2_valid &lt;- X[random_indices[(n1+1):n2], ] Y2_valid &lt;- Y[random_indices[(n1+1):n2] ] X2_test &lt;- X[random_indices[(n2+1):n ], ] Y2_test &lt;- Y[random_indices[(n2+1):n ] ] stopifnot(nrow(X2_train)+nrow(X2_valid)+nrow(X2_test) == nrow(X)) Exercise. Find the best \\(K\\) on the validation set and compute the error metrics on the test set. Remark. (*) If our dataset is too small, we can use various cross-validation techniques instead of a train-validate-test split. 3.4 Implementing a K-NN Classifier (*) 3.4.1 Factor Data Type Recall that (see Appendix B for more details) factor type in R is a very convenient means to encode categorical data (such as \\(\\mathbf{y}\\)): x &lt;- c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;) f &lt;- factor(x, levels=c(&quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;)) f ## [1] yes no no yes no ## Levels: no yes table(f) # counts ## f ## no yes ## 3 2 Internally, objects of type factor are represented as integer vectors with elements in \\(\\{1,\\dots,M\\}\\), where \\(M\\) is the number of possible levels. Labels, used to “decipher” the numeric codes, are stored separately. as.numeric(f) # 2nd label, 1st label, 1st label etc. ## [1] 2 1 1 2 1 levels(f) ## [1] &quot;no&quot; &quot;yes&quot; levels(f) &lt;- c(&quot;failure&quot;, &quot;success&quot;) # re-encode f ## [1] success failure failure success failure ## Levels: failure success 3.4.2 Main Routine (*) Let’s implement a K-NN classifier ourselves by using a top-bottom approach. We will start with a general description of the admissible inputs and the expected output. Then we will arrange the processing of data into conveniently manageable chunks. The function’s declaration will look like: our_knn &lt;- function(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=1) { # k=1 denotes a parameter with a default value # ... } Load an example dataset on which we will test our algorithm: wines &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/winequality-all.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) wines &lt;- wines[wines$color == &quot;white&quot;,] X &lt;- as.matrix(wines[,1:10]) Y &lt;- factor(as.character(as.numeric(wines$alcohol &gt;= 12))) Note that Y is now a factor object. Train-test split: set.seed(123) random_indices &lt;- sample(n) train_indices &lt;- random_indices[1:floor(n*0.6)] X_train &lt;- X[train_indices,] Y_train &lt;- Y[train_indices] X_test &lt;- X[-train_indices,] Y_test &lt;- Y[-train_indices] First, we should specify the type and form of the arguments we’re expecting: # this is the body of our_knn() - part 1 stopifnot(is.numeric(X_train), is.matrix(X_train)) stopifnot(is.numeric(X_test), is.matrix(X_test)) stopifnot(is.factor(Y_train)) stopifnot(ncol(X_train) == ncol(X_test)) stopifnot(nrow(X_train) == length(Y_train)) stopifnot(k &gt;= 1) n_train &lt;- nrow(X_train) n_test &lt;- nrow(X_test) p &lt;- ncol(X_train) M &lt;- length(levels(Y_train)) Therefore, \\(\\mathtt{X\\_train}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathtt{n\\_train}\\times \\mathtt{p}}\\), \\(\\mathtt{X\\_test}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathtt{n\\_test}\\times \\mathtt{p}}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{Y\\_train}\\in\\{1,\\dots,M\\}^{\\mathtt{n\\_train}}\\) Remark. Recall that R factor objects are internally encoded as integer vectors. Next, we will call the (to-be-done) function our_get_knnx(), which seeks nearest neighbours of all the points: # our_get_knnx returns a matrix nn_indices of size n_test*k, # where nn_indices[i,j] denotes the index of # X_test[i,]&#39;s j-th nearest neighbour in X_train. # (It is the point X_train[nn_indices[i,j],]). nn_indices &lt;- our_get_knnx(X_train, X_test, k) Then, for each point in X_test, we fetch the labels corresponding to its nearest neighbours and compute their mode: Y_pred &lt;- numeric(n_test) # vector of length n_test # For now we will operate on the integer labels in {1,...,M} Y_train_int &lt;- as.numeric(Y_train) for (i in 1:n_test) { # Get the labels of the NNs of the i-th point: nn_labels_i &lt;- Y_train_int[nn_indices[i,]] # Compute the mode (majority vote): Y_pred[i] &lt;- our_mode(nn_labels_i) # in {1,...,M} } Finally, we should convert the resulting integer vector to an object of type factor: # Convert Y_pred to factor: return(factor(Y_pred, labels=levels(Y_train))) 3.4.3 Mode To implement the mode, we can use the tabulate() function. Exercise. Read the function’s man page, see ?tabulate. For example: tabulate(c(1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2)) ## [1] 4 2 0 0 1 There might be multiple modes – in such a case, we should pick one at random. For that, we can use the sample() function. Exercise. Read the function’s man page, see ?sample. Note that its behaviour is different when it’s first argument is a vector of length 1. An example implementation: our_mode &lt;- function(Y) { # tabulate() will take care of # checking the correctness of Y t &lt;- tabulate(Y) mode_candidates &lt;- which(t == max(t)) if (length(mode_candidates) == 1) return(mode_candidates) else return(sample(mode_candidates, 1)) } our_mode(c(1, 1, 1, 1)) ## [1] 1 our_mode(c(2, 2, 2, 2)) ## [1] 2 our_mode(c(3, 1, 3, 3)) ## [1] 3 our_mode(c(1, 1, 3, 3, 2)) ## [1] 3 our_mode(c(1, 1, 3, 3, 2)) ## [1] 1 3.4.4 NN Search Routines (*) Last but not least, we should implement the our_get_knnx() function. It is the function responsible for seeking the indices of nearest neighbours. It turns out this function will actually constitute the K-NN classifier’s performance bottleneck in case of big data samples. # our_get_knnx returns a matrix nn_indices of size n_test*k, # where nn_indices[i,j] denotes the index of # X_test[i,]&#39;s j-th nearest neighbour in X_train. # (It is the point X_train[nn_indices[i,j],]). our_get_knnx &lt;- function(X_train, X_test, k) { # ... } A naive approach to our_get_knnx() relies on computing all pairwise distances, and sorting them. our_get_knnx &lt;- function(X_train, X_test, k) { n_test &lt;- nrow(X_test) nn_indices &lt;- matrix(NA_real_, nrow=n_test, ncol=k) for (i in 1:n_test) { d &lt;- apply(X_train, 1, function(x) sqrt(sum((x-X_test[i,])^2))) # now d[j] is the distance # between X_train[j,] and X_test[i,] nn_indices[i,] &lt;- order(d)[1:k] } nn_indices } A comparison with FNN:knn(): system.time(Ya &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.135 0.000 0.134 system.time(Yb &lt;- our_knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5)) ## user system elapsed ## 15.387 0.000 15.388 mean(Ya == Yb) # 1.0 on perfect match ## [1] 1 Both functions return identical results but our implementation is “slightly” slower. FNN:knn() is efficiently written in C++, which is a compiled programming language. R, on the other hand (just like Python and Matlab) is interpreted, therefore as a rule of thumb we should consider it an order of magnitude slower (see, however, the Julia language). Let’s substitute our naive implementation with the equivalent one, but written in C++ (available in the FNN package). Remark. (*) Note that we can write a C++ implementation ourselves, see the Rcpp package for seamless R and C++ integration. our_get_knnx &lt;- function(X_train, X_test, k) { # this is used by our_knn() FNN::get.knnx(X_train, X_test, k, algorithm=&quot;brute&quot;)$nn.index } system.time(Ya &lt;- knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.137 0.000 0.137 system.time(Yb &lt;- our_knn(X_train, X_test, Y_train, k=5)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.046 0.000 0.047 mean(Ya == Yb) # 1.0 on perfect match ## [1] 1 Note that our solution requires \\(c\\cdot n_\\text{test}\\cdot n_\\text{train}\\cdot p\\) arithmetic operations for some \\(c&gt;1\\). The overall cost of sorting is at least \\(d\\cdot n_\\text{test}\\cdot n_\\text{train}\\cdot\\log n_\\text{train}\\) for some \\(d&gt;1\\). This does not scale well with both \\(n_\\text{test}\\) and \\(n_\\text{train}\\) (think – big data). It turns out that there are special spatial data structures – such as metric trees – that aim to speed up searching for nearest neighbours in low-dimensional spaces (for small \\(p\\)). Remark. (*) Searching in high-dimensional spaces is hard due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. For example, FNN::get.knnx() also implements the so-called kd-trees. library(&quot;microbenchmark&quot;) test_speed &lt;- function(n, p, k) { A &lt;- matrix(runif(n*p), nrow=n, ncol=p) s &lt;- summary(microbenchmark::microbenchmark( brute=FNN::get.knnx(A, A, k, algorithm=&quot;brute&quot;), kd_tree=FNN::get.knnx(A, A, k, algorithm=&quot;kd_tree&quot;), times=3 ), unit=&quot;s&quot;) # minima of 3 time measurements: structure(s$min, names=as.character(s$expr)) } test_speed(10000, 2, 5) ## brute kd_tree ## 0.293616 0.012172 test_speed(10000, 5, 5) ## brute kd_tree ## 0.435148 0.061757 test_speed(10000, 10, 5) ## brute kd_tree ## 0.64483 0.65084 test_speed(10000, 20, 5) ## brute kd_tree ## 1.2602 5.2480 3.4.5 Different Metrics (*) The Euclidean distance is just one particular example of many possible metrics (metric == a mathematical term, above we have used this term in a more relaxed fashion, when referring to accuracy etc.). Mathematically, we say that \\(d\\) is a metric on a set \\(X\\) (e.g., \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\)), whenever it is a function \\(d:X\\times X\\to [0,\\infty]\\) such that for all \\(x,x&#39;,x&#39;&#39;\\in X\\): \\(d(x, x&#39;) = 0\\) if and only if \\(x=x&#39;\\), \\(d(x, x&#39;) = d(x&#39;, x)\\) (it is symmetric) \\(d(x, x&#39;&#39;) \\le d(x, x&#39;) + d(x&#39;, x&#39;&#39;)\\) (it fulfils the triangle inequality) Remark. (*) Not all the properties are required in all the applications; sometimes we might need a few additional ones. We can easily generalise the way we introduced the K-NN method to have a classifier that is based on a point’s neighbourhood with respect to any metric. Example metrics on \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\): Euclidean \\[ d_2(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}&#39;) = \\| \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}&#39; \\| = \\| \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}&#39; \\|_2 = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^p (x_i-x_i&#39;)^2 } \\] Manhattan (taxicab) \\[ d_1(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}&#39;) = \\| \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}&#39; \\|_1 = { \\sum_{i=1}^p |x_i-x_i&#39;| } \\] Chebyshev (maximum) \\[ d_\\infty(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}&#39;) = \\| \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}&#39; \\|_\\infty = \\max_{i=1,\\dots,p} |x_i-x_i&#39;| \\] We can define metrics on different spaces too. For example, the Levenshtein distance is a popular choice for comparing character strings (also DNA sequences etc.) It is an edit distance – it measures the minimal number of single-character insertions, deletions or substitutions to change one string into another. For instance: adist(&quot;happy&quot;, &quot;nap&quot;) ## [,1] ## [1,] 3 This is because we need 1 substitution and 2 deletions, happy → nappy → napp → nap. See also: the Hamming distance for categorical vectors (or strings of equal lengths), the Jaccard distance for sets, the Kendall tau rank distance for rankings. Moreover, R package stringdist includes implementations of numerous string metrics. 3.5 Outro 3.5.1 Remarks Note that K-NN is suitable for any kind of multiclass classification. However, in practice it’s pretty slow for larger datasets – to classify a single point we have to query the whole training set (which should be available at all times). In the next part we will discuss some other well-known classifiers: Decision trees Logistic regression 3.5.2 Side Note: K-NN Regression The K-Nearest Neighbour scheme is intuitively pleasing. No wonder it has inspired a similar approach for solving a regression task. In order to make a prediction for a new point \\(\\mathbf{x}&#39;\\): find the K-nearest neighbours of \\(\\mathbf{x}&#39;\\) amongst the points in the train set, denoted \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i_1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_{i_K,\\cdot}\\), fetch the corresponding reference outputs \\(y_{i_1}, \\dots, y_{i_K}\\), return their arithmetic mean as a result, \\[\\hat{y}=\\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{j=1}^K y_{i_j}.\\] Recall our modelling of the Credit Rating (\\(Y\\)) as a function of the average Credit Card Balance (\\(X\\)) based on the ISLR::Credit dataset. library(&quot;ISLR&quot;) # Credit dataset Xc &lt;- as.matrix(as.numeric(Credit$Balance[Credit$Balance&gt;0])) Yc &lt;- as.matrix(as.numeric(Credit$Rating[Credit$Balance&gt;0])) library(&quot;FNN&quot;) # knn.reg function x &lt;- as.matrix(seq(min(Xc), max(Xc), length.out=101)) y1 &lt;- knn.reg(Xc, x, Yc, k=1)$pred y5 &lt;- knn.reg(Xc, x, Yc, k=5)$pred y25 &lt;- knn.reg(Xc, x, Yc, k=25)$pred The three models are depicted in Figure 3.7. Again, the higher the \\(K\\), the smoother the curve. On the other hand, for small \\(K\\) we adapt better to what’s in a point’s neighbourhood. plot(Xc, Yc, col=&quot;#666666c0&quot;, xlab=&quot;Balance&quot;, ylab=&quot;Rating&quot;) lines(x, y1, col=2, lwd=3) lines(x, y5, col=3, lwd=3) lines(x, y25, col=4, lwd=3) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend=c(&quot;K=1&quot;, &quot;K=5&quot;, &quot;K=25&quot;), col=c(2, 3, 4), lwd=3, bg=&quot;white&quot;) Figure 3.7: K-NN regression example 3.5.3 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (Hastie et al. 2017: Section 13.3) References "],

Stay tuned. 4.1 Introduction 4.1.1 Classification Task Let \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) be an input matrix that consists of \\(n\\) points in a \\(p\\)-dimensional space (each of the \\(n\\) objects is described by means of \\(p\\) numerical features) Recall that in supervised learning, with each \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) we associate the desired output \\(y_i\\). Hence, our dataset is \\([\\mathbf{X}\\ \\mathbf{y}]\\) – where each object is represented as a row vector \\([\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\ y_i]\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\): \\[ [\\mathbf{X}\\ \\mathbf{y}]= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} &amp; y_1\\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} &amp; y_2\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} &amp; y_n\\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] In this chapter we are still interested in classification tasks; we assume that each \\(y_i\\) is a descriptive label. Let’s assume that we are faced with binary classification tasks. Hence, there are only two possible labels that we traditionally denote with \\(0\\)s and \\(1\\)s. For example: 0 1 no yes false true failure success healthy ill Let’s recall the synthetic 2D dataset from the previous chapter (true decision boundary is at \\(X_1=0\\)), see Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1: A synthetic 2D dataset with the true decision boundary at \\(X_1=0\\) 4.1.2 Data For illustration, we’ll be considering the Wine Quality dataset (white wines only): wines &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/winequality-all.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) wines &lt;- wines[wines$color == &quot;white&quot;,] (n &lt;- nrow(wines)) # number of samples ## [1] 4898 The input matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) consists of the first 10 numeric variables: X &lt;- as.matrix(wines[,1:10]) dim(X) ## [1] 4898 10 head(X, 2) # first two rows ## fixed.acidity volatile.acidity citric.acid residual.sugar ## 1600 7.0 0.27 0.36 20.7 ## 1601 6.3 0.30 0.34 1.6 ## chlorides free.sulfur.dioxide total.sulfur.dioxide density pH ## 1600 0.045 45 170 1.001 3.0 ## 1601 0.049 14 132 0.994 3.3 ## sulphates ## 1600 0.45 ## 1601 0.49 The 11th variable measures the amount of alcohol (in %).

The whole training set must be stored and referred to at all times. Therefore, it doesn’t explain the data we have – we may use it solely for the purpose of prediction. Perhaps one of the most interpretable (and hence human-friendly) models consist of decision rules of the form: IF \\(x_{i,j_1}\\le v_1\\) AND … AND \\(x_{i,j_r}\\le v_r\\) THEN \\(\\hat{y}_i=1\\). These can be organised into a hierarchy for greater readability. This idea inspired the notion of decision trees (Breiman et al. 1984). (#fig:plot_rpart) The simplest decision tree for the synthetic 2D dataset and the corresponding decision boundaries Figure 4.2 depicts a very simple decision tree for the aforementioned synthetic dataset. There is only one decision boundary (based on \\(X_1\\)) that splits data into the “left” and “right” sides. Each tree node reports 3 pieces of information: dominating class (0 or 1) (relative) proportion of 1s represented in a node (absolute) proportion of all observations in a node Figures 4.2 and 4.3 depict trees with more decision rules. Take a moment to contemplate how the corresponding decision boundaries changed with the introduction of new decision rules. Figure 4.2: A more complicated decision tree for the synthetic 2D dataset and the corresponding decision boundaries Figure 4.3: An even more complicated decision tree for the synthetic 2D dataset and the corresponding decision boundaries 4.2.2 Example in R We will use the rpart() function from the rpart package to build a classification tree. library(&quot;rpart&quot;) library(&quot;rpart.plot&quot;) set.seed(123) rpart() uses a formula (~) interface, hence it will be easier to feed it with data in a data.frame form. XY_train &lt;- cbind(as.data.frame(X_train), Y=Y_train) XY_test &lt;- cbind(as.data.frame(X_test), Y=Y_test) Fit and plot a decision tree, see Figure 4.4. t1 &lt;- rpart(Y~., data=XY_train, method=&quot;class&quot;) rpart.plot(t1, tweak=1.1, fallen.leaves=FALSE, digits=3) Figure 4.4: A decision tree for the wines dataset We can build less or more complex trees by playing with the cp parameter, see Figures 4.5 and 4.6. # cp = complexity parameter, smaller → more complex tree t2 &lt;- rpart(Y~., data=XY_train, method=&quot;class&quot;, cp=0.1) rpart.plot(t2, tweak=1.1, fallen.leaves=FALSE, digits=3) Figure 4.5: A (simpler) decision tree for the wines dataset # cp = complexity parameter, smaller → more complex tree t3 &lt;- rpart(Y~., data=XY_train, method=&quot;class&quot;, cp=0.00001) rpart.plot(t3, tweak=1.1, fallen.leaves=FALSE, digits=3) Figure 4.6: A (more complex) decision tree for the wines dataset Trees with few decision rules actually are very nicely interpretable. On the other hand, plotting of the complex ones is just hopeless; we should treat them as “black boxes” instead.

Examples: ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) (Quinlan 1986) C4.5 algorithm (Quinlan 1993) CART by Leo Breiman et al., (Breiman et al. 1984) (**) Decision trees are most often constructed by a greedy, top-down recursive partitioning, see., e.g., (Therneau &amp; Atkinson 2019). 4.3 Binary Logistic Regression 4.3.1 Motivation Recall that for a regression task, we fitted a very simple family of models – the linear ones – by minimising the sum of squared residuals. This approach was pretty effective. (Very) theoretically, we could treat the class labels as numeric \\(0\\)s and \\(1\\)s and apply regression models in a binary classification task. XY_train_r &lt;- cbind(as.data.frame(X_train), Y=as.numeric(Y_train)-1 # 0.0 or 1.0 ) XY_test_r &lt;- cbind(as.data.frame(X_test), Y=as.numeric(Y_test)-1 # 0.0 or 1.0 ) f_r &lt;- lm(Y~density+residual.sugar+pH, data=XY_train_r) Y_pred_r &lt;- predict(f_r, XY_test_r) summary(Y_pred_r) ## Min. 1st Qu.

Y_pred &lt;- as.numeric(Y_pred_r&gt;0.5) round(get_metrics(Y_pred, XY_test_r$Y), 3) ## Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP ## 0.927 0.865 0.647 0.740 1611.000 112.000 32.000 205.000 Remark. (*) The threshold \\(T=0.5\\) could even be treated as a free parameter we optimise for (w.r.t. different metrics over the validation sample), see Figure 4.7. Figure 4.7: Quality metrics for a binary classifier “Classify X as 1 if \\(f(X)&gt;T\\) and as 0 if \\(f(X)\\le T\\)” Despite we can, we shouldn’t use linear regression for classification. Treating class labels “0” and “1” as ordinary real numbers just doesn’t cut it – we intuitively feel that we are doing something ugly. Luckily, there is a better, more meaningful approach that still relies on a linear model, but has the right semantics. 4.3.2 Logistic Model Inspired by this idea, we could try modelling the probability that a given point belongs to class \\(1\\). This could also provide us with the confidence in our prediction. Probability is a number in \\([0,1]\\), but the outputs of a linear model are arbitrary real numbers. However, we could transform those real-valued outputs by means of some function \\(\\phi:\\mathbb{R}\\to[0,1]\\) (preferably S-shaped == sigmoid), so as to get: \\[ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=\\phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p). \\] Remark. The above reads as “Probability that \\(Y\\) is from class 1 given \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\)”. A popular choice is the logistic sigmoid function, see Figure 4.8: \\[ \\phi(t) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}} = \\frac{e^t}{1+e^t}. \\] Figure 4.8: The logistic sigmoid function, \\(\\varphi\\) Hence our model becomes: \\[ Y=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}} \\] It is an instance of a generalised linear model (glm) (there are of course many other possible generalisations). 4.3.3 Example in R Let us first fit a simple (i.e., \\(p=1\\)) logistic regression model using the density variable. The goodness-of-fit measure used in this problem will be discussed a bit later. (f &lt;- glm(Y~density, data=XY_train, family=binomial(&quot;logit&quot;))) ## ## Call: glm(formula = Y ~ density, family = binomial(&quot;logit&quot;), data = XY_train) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) density ## 1173 -1184 ## ## Degrees of Freedom: 2937 Total (i.e. Null); 2936 Residual ## Null Deviance: 2670 ## Residual Deviance: 1420 AIC: 1420 “logit” above denotes the inverse of the logistic sigmoid function. The fitted coefficients are equal to: f$coefficients ## (Intercept) density ## 1173.2 -1184.2 Figure 4.9 depicts the obtained model, which can be written as: \\[ \\Pr(Y=1|x)=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\left( 1173.21-1184.21x \\right)} } \\] with \\(x=\\text{density}\\). Figure 4.9: The probability that a given wine is a high-alcohol one given its density; black and red points denote the actual observed data points from the class 0 and 1, respectively Some predicted probabilities: round(head(predict(f, XY_test, type=&quot;response&quot;), 12), 2) ## 1602 1605 1607 1608 1609 1613 1614 1615 1621 1622 1623 1627 ## 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.02 0.03 0.36 0.00 0.31 0.36 0.06 0.03 0.00 We classify \\(Y\\) as 1 if the corresponding membership probability is greater than \\(0.5\\).

Try fitting different models based on other sets of features. 4.3.4 Loss Function: Cross-entropy The fitting of the model can be written as an optimisation task: \\[ \\min_{\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\dots, \\beta_p\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon\\left(\\hat{y}_i, y_i \\right) \\] where \\(\\epsilon(\\hat{y}_i, y_i)\\) denotes the penalty that measures the “difference” between the true \\(y_i\\) and its predicted version \\(\\hat{y}_i=\\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta)\\). In the ordinary regression, we used the squared residual \\(\\epsilon(\\hat{y}_i, y_i) = (\\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2\\). In logistic regression (the kind of a classifier we are interested in right now), we use the cross-entropy (a.k.a. log-loss, binary cross-entropy), \\[ \\epsilon(\\hat{y}_i,y_i) = - \\left(y_i \\log \\hat{y}_i + (1-y_i) \\log(1-\\hat{y}_i)\\right) \\] The corresponding loss function has not only many nice statistical properties (** related to maximum likelihood estimation etc.) but also an intuitive interpretation. Note that the predicted \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is in \\((0,1)\\) and the true \\(y_i\\) equals to either 0 or 1. Recall also that \\(\\log t\\in(-\\infty, 0)\\) for \\(t\\in (0,1)\\). Therefore, the formula for \\(\\epsilon(\\hat{y}_i,y_i)\\) has a very intuitive behaviour: if true \\(y_i=1\\), then the penalty becomes \\(\\epsilon(\\hat{y}_i, 1) = -\\log(\\hat{y}_i)\\) \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is the probability that the classified input is indeed from class \\(1\\) we’d be happy if the classifier outputted \\(\\hat{y}_i\\simeq 1\\) in this case; this is not penalised as \\(-\\log(t)\\to 0\\) as \\(t\\to 1\\) however, if the classifier is totally wrong, i.e., it thinks that \\(\\hat{y}_i\\simeq 0\\), then the penalty will be very high, as \\(-\\log(t)\\to+\\infty\\) as \\(t\\to 0\\) if true \\(y_i=0\\), then the penalty becomes \\(\\epsilon(\\hat{y}_i, 0) = -\\log(1-\\hat{y}_i)\\) \\(1-\\hat{y}_i\\) is the predicted probability that the input is from class \\(0\\) we penalise heavily the case where \\(1-\\hat{y}_i\\) is small (we’d be happy if the classifier was sure that \\(1-\\hat{y}_i\\simeq 1\\), because this is the ground-truth) (*) Having said that, let’s expand the above formulae. The task of minimising cross-entropy in the binary logistic regression can be written as \\(\\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p+1}} E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)\\) with: \\[ E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)= -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\log \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta) + (1-y_i) \\log(1-\\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta)) \\] Taking into account that: \\[ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta)= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}}, \\] we get: \\[ E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)= -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\begin{array}{r} y_i \\log \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}}\\\\ + (1-y_i) \\log \\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}} \\end{array} \\right). \\] Logarithms are really practitioner-friendly functions, it holds: \\(\\log 1=0\\), \\(\\log e=1\\) (where \\(e \\simeq 2.71828\\) is the Euler constant; note that by writing \\(\\log\\) we mean the natural a.k.a. base-\\(e\\) logarithm), \\(\\log xy = \\log x + \\log y\\), \\(\\log x^p = p\\log x\\) (this is \\(\\log (x^p)\\), not \\((\\log x)^p\\)). These facts imply, amongst others that: \\(\\log e^x = x \\log e = x\\), \\(\\log \\frac{x}{y} = \\log x y^{-1} = \\log x+\\log y^{-1} = \\log x - \\log y\\) (of course for \\(y\\neq 0\\)), \\(\\log \\frac{1}{y} = -\\log y\\) and so forth. Therefore, based on the fact that \\(1/(1+e^{-x})=e^x/(1+e^x)\\), the above optimisation problem can be rewritten as: \\[ E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\begin{array}{r} y_i \\log \\left(1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}\\right)\\\\ + (1-y_i) \\log \\left(1+e^{+(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}\\right) \\end{array} \\right) \\] or, if someone prefers: \\[ E(\\boldsymbol\\beta)= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( (1-y_i)\\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}\\right) +\\log \\left(1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}\\right) \\right). \\] It turns out that there is no analytical formula for the optimal set of parameters (\\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p\\) minimising the log-loss). In the chapter on optimisation, we shall see that the solution to the logistic regression can be solved numerically by means of quite simple iterative algorithms. The two expanded formulae have lost the appealing interpretation of the original one, however, it’s more numerically well-behaving, see, e.g., the log1p() function in base R or, even better, fermi_dirac_0() in the gsl package. 4.4 Exercises in R 4.4.1 EdStats – Preparing Data In this exercise, we will prepare the EdStats dataset for further analysis. The file edstats_2019.csv provides us with many country-level Education Statistics extracted from the World Bank’s Databank, see https://databank.worldbank.org/. Databank aggregates information from such sources as the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) etc. The official description reads: “The World Bank EdStats Query holds around 2,500 internationally comparable education indicators for access, progression, completion, literacy, teachers, population, and expenditures. The indicators cover the education cycle from pre-primary to tertiary education. The query also holds learning outcome data from international learning assessments (PISA, TIMSS, etc.), equity data from household surveys, and projection data to 2050.” edstats_2019.csv was compiled on 24 April 2020 and lists indicators reported between 2010 and 2019.

To recall, na.omit(), removes all missing values and tail() can be used to access the last observation easily. Unfortunately, if the vector is consists of missing values only, the removal of NAs leads to an empty sequence. However, the trick we can use is that by extracting the first element from an empty vector by using [...], we get a NA. last_non_na &lt;- function(x) tail(na.omit(x), 1)[1] last_non_na(c(1, 2, NA, 3,NA,NA)) # example 1 ## [1] 3 last_non_na(c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA)) # example 2 ## [1] NA Let’s extract the most recent indicator from each row in edstats_2019. values &lt;- apply(edstats_2019[-(1:4)], 1, last_non_na) head(values) ## [1] 4.0589 82.8503 NA 85.6253 NA NA Now, we shall create a data frame with 3 columns: name of the country, indicator code, indicator value. Let’s order it with respect to the first two columns. edstats_2019 &lt;- edstats_2019[c(&quot;CountryName&quot;, &quot;Code&quot;)] # add a new column at the righthand end: edstats_2019[&quot;Value&quot;] &lt;- values edstats_2019 &lt;- edstats_2019[ order(edstats_2019$CountryName, edstats_2019$Code), ] head(edstats_2019) ## CountryName Code Value ## 59 Afghanistan HD.HCI.AMRT 0.7797 ## 57 Afghanistan HD.HCI.AMRT.FE 0.8018 ## 58 Afghanistan HD.HCI.AMRT.MA 0.7597 ## 53 Afghanistan HD.HCI.EYRS 8.5800 ## 51 Afghanistan HD.HCI.EYRS.FE 6.7300 ## 52 Afghanistan HD.HCI.EYRS.MA 9.2100 To convert the data frame to a “wide” format, many readers would choose the pivot_wider() function from the tidyr package (amongst others). library(&quot;tidyr&quot;) edstats &lt;- as.data.frame( pivot_wider(edstats_2019, names_from=&quot;Code&quot;, values_from=&quot;Value&quot;) ) edstats[1, 1:7] ## CountryName HD.HCI.AMRT HD.HCI.AMRT.FE HD.HCI.AMRT.MA HD.HCI.EYRS ## 1 Afghanistan 0.7797 0.8018 0.7597 8.58 ## HD.HCI.EYRS.FE HD.HCI.EYRS.MA ## 1 6.73 9.21 On a side note (*), the above solution is of course perfectly fine and we can now live long and prosper. Nevertheless, we are here to learn new skills, so let’s note that it has the drawback that it required us to search for the answer on the internet (and go through many “answers” that actually don’t work). If we are not converting between the long and the wide formats on a daily basis, this might not be worth the hassle (moreover, there’s no guarantee that this function will work the same way in the future, that the package we relied on will provide the same API etc.). Instead, by relaying on a bit deeper knowledge of R programming (which we already have, see Appendices A-D of our book), we could implement the relevant procedure manually. The downside is that this requires us to get out of our comfort zone and… think. First, let’s generate the list of all countries and indicators: countries &lt;- unique(edstats_2019$CountryName) head(countries) ## [1] &quot;Afghanistan&quot; &quot;Albania&quot; &quot;Algeria&quot; &quot;American Samoa&quot; ## [5] &quot;Andorra&quot; &quot;Angola&quot; indicators &lt;- unique(edstats_2019$Code) head(indicators) ## [1] &quot;HD.HCI.AMRT&quot; &quot;HD.HCI.AMRT.FE&quot; &quot;HD.HCI.AMRT.MA&quot; &quot;HD.HCI.EYRS&quot; ## [5] &quot;HD.HCI.EYRS.FE&quot; &quot;HD.HCI.EYRS.MA&quot; Second, note that edstats_2019 gives all the possible combinations (pairs) of the indexes and countries: nrow(edstats_2019) # number of rows in edstats_2019 ## [1] 23852 length(countries)*length(indicators) # number of pairs ## [1] 23852 Looking at the numbers in the Value column of edstats_2019, this will exactly provide us with our desired “wide” data matrix, if we read it in a rowwise manner. Hence, we can use matrix(..., byrow=TRUE) to generate it: # edstats_2019 is already sorted w.r.t. CountryName and Code edstats2 &lt;- cbind( CountryName=countries, # first column as.data.frame( matrix(edstats_2019$Value, byrow=TRUE, ncol=length(indicators), dimnames=list(NULL, indicators) ))) identical(edstats, edstats2) ## [1] TRUE Exercise. Export edstats to a CSV file. Click here for a solution. This can be done as follows: write.csv(edstats, &quot;edstats_2019_wide.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE) We didn’t export the row names, because they’re useless in our case. Exercise. Explore edstats_meta.csv to understand the meaning of the EdStats indicators. Click here for a solution. First, let’s load the dataset: meta &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/edstats_meta.csv&quot;) names(meta) # column names ## [1] &quot;Code&quot; &quot;Series&quot; &quot;Definition&quot; &quot;Source&quot; &quot;Topic&quot; The Series column deciphers each indicator’s meaning. For instance, LO.PISA.MAT gives: meta[meta$Code==&quot;LO.PISA.MAT&quot;, &quot;Series&quot;] ## [1] &quot;PISA: Mean performance on the mathematics scale&quot; To get more information, we can take a look at the Definition column: meta[meta$Code==&quot;LO.PISA.MAT&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;] which reads: Average score of 15-year-old students on the PISA mathematics scale. The metric for the overall mathematics scale is based on a mean for OECD countries of 500 points and a standard deviation of 100 points. Data reflects country performance in the stated year according to PISA reports, but may not be comparable across years or countries. Consult the PISA website for more detailed information: http://www.oecd.org/pisa/. 4.4.2 EdStats – Where Girls Are Better at Maths Than Boys? In this task we will consider the “wide” version of the EdStats dataset: edstats &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/edstats_2019_wide.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) edstats[1, 1:6] ## CountryName HD.HCI.AMRT HD.HCI.AMRT.FE HD.HCI.AMRT.MA HD.HCI.EYRS ## 1 Afghanistan 0.7797 0.8018 0.7597 8.58 ## HD.HCI.EYRS.FE ## 1 6.73 meta &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/edstats_meta.csv&quot;) This dataset is small, moreover, we’ll be more interested in the description (understanding) of data, not prediction of the response variable to unobserved samples. Note that we have the population of the World countries at hand here (new countries do not arise on a daily basis). Therefore, a train-test split won’t be performed. Exercise. Add a 0/1 factor-type variable girls_rule_maths that is equal to 1 if and only if a country’s average score of 15-year-old female students on the PISA mathematics scale is greater than the corresponding indicator for the male ones. Click here for a solution. Recall that a conversion of a logical value to a number yields 1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE. Hence: edstats$girls_rule_maths &lt;- factor(as.numeric( edstats$LO.PISA.MAT.FE&gt;edstats$LO.PISA.MAT.MA )) head(edstats$girls_rule_maths, 10) ## [1] &lt;NA&gt; 1 1 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 0 &lt;NA&gt; ## Levels: 0 1 Unfortunately, there are many missing values in the dataset. More precisely: sum(is.na(edstats$girls_rule_maths)) # count ## [1] 187 mean(is.na(edstats$girls_rule_maths)) # proportion ## [1] 0.69776 Countries such as Egypt, India, Iran or Venezuela are not amongst the 79 members of the Programme for International Student Assessment. Thus, we’ll have to deal with the data we have. The percentage of counties where “girls rule” is equal to: mean(edstats$girls_rule_maths==1, na.rm=TRUE) ## [1] 0.33333 Here is the list of those counties: as.character(na.omit( edstats[edstats$girls_rule_maths==1, &quot;CountryName&quot;] )) ## [1] &quot;Albania&quot; &quot;Algeria&quot; ## [3] &quot;Brunei Darussalam&quot; &quot;Bulgaria&quot; ## [5] &quot;Cyprus&quot; &quot;Dominican Republic&quot; ## [7] &quot;Finland&quot; &quot;Georgia&quot; ## [9] &quot;Hong Kong SAR, China&quot; &quot;Iceland&quot; ## [11] &quot;Indonesia&quot; &quot;Israel&quot; ## [13] &quot;Jordan&quot; &quot;Lithuania&quot; ## [15] &quot;Malaysia&quot; &quot;Malta&quot; ## [17] &quot;Moldova&quot; &quot;North Macedonia&quot; ## [19] &quot;Norway&quot; &quot;Philippines&quot; ## [21] &quot;Qatar&quot; &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot; ## [23] &quot;Sweden&quot; &quot;Thailand&quot; ## [25] &quot;Trinidad and Tobago&quot; &quot;United Arab Emirates&quot; ## [27] &quot;Vietnam&quot; Exercise. Learn a decision tree that distinguishes between the countries where girls are better at maths than boys and assess the quality of this classifier. Click here for a solution. Let’s first create a subset of edstats that doesn’t include the country names as well as the boys’ and girls’ math scores. edstats_subset &lt;- edstats[!(names(edstats) %in% c(&quot;CountryName&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.MAT.FE&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.MAT.MA&quot;))] Fitting and plotting (see Figure 4.10) of the tree can be performed as follows: library(&quot;rpart&quot;) library(&quot;rpart.plot&quot;) tree &lt;- rpart(girls_rule_maths~., data=edstats_subset, method=&quot;class&quot;, model=TRUE) rpart.plot(tree) Figure 4.10: A decision tree explaining the girls_rule_maths variable The variables included in the model are: Note that the decision rules are well-interpretable, we can make a whole story around it. Whether or not it is actually true – is a different… story. To compute the basic classifier performance scores, let’s recall the get_metrics() function: get_metrics &lt;- function(Y_pred, Y_test) { C &lt;- table(Y_pred, Y_test) # confusion matrix stopifnot(dim(C) == c(2, 2)) c(Acc=(C[1,1]+C[2,2])/sum(C), # accuracy Prec=C[2,2]/(C[2,2]+C[2,1]), # precision Rec=C[2,2]/(C[2,2]+C[1,2]), # recall F=C[2,2]/(C[2,2]+0.5*C[1,2]+0.5*C[2,1]), # F-measure # Confusion matrix items: TN=C[1,1], FN=C[1,2], FP=C[2,1], TP=C[2,2] ) # return a named vector } Now we can judge the tree’s character: Y_pred &lt;- predict(tree, edstats_subset, type=&quot;class&quot;) get_metrics(Y_pred, edstats_subset$girls_rule_maths) ## Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP ## 0.81481 1.00000 0.44444 0.61538 54.00000 15.00000 0.00000 12.00000 Exercise. Learn a decision tree that this time doesn’t rely on any of the PISA indicators. Click here for a solution. Let’s remove the unwanted variables: edstats_subset &lt;- edstats[!(names(edstats) %in% c(&quot;LO.PISA.MAT&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.MAT.FE&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.MAT.MA&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.REA&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.REA.FE&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.REA.MA&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.SCI&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.SCI.FE&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.SCI.MA&quot;, &quot;CountryName&quot;))] On a side note, this could be done more easily by calling, e.g., stri_startswith_fixed(names(edstats), \"LO.PISA\") from the stringi package. Fitting and plotting (see Figure 4.11) of the tree: tree &lt;- rpart(girls_rule_maths~., data=edstats_subset, method=&quot;class&quot;, model=TRUE) rpart.plot(tree) Figure 4.11: Another decision tree explaining the girls_rule_maths variable Performance metrics: Y_pred &lt;- predict(tree, edstats, type=&quot;class&quot;) get_metrics(Y_pred, edstats_subset$girls_rule_maths) ## Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP ## 0.79012 0.69231 0.66667 0.67925 46.00000 9.00000 8.00000 18.00000 It’s interesting to note that some of the goodness-of-fit measures are actually higher now. The variables included in the model are: 4.4.3 EdStats and World Factbook – Joining Forces In the course of our data science journey, we have considered two datasets dealing with country-level indicators: the World Factbook and World Bank’s EdStats. factbook &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/world_factbook_2020.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) edstats &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/edstats_2019_wide.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) Let’s combine the information they provide and see if we come up with a better model of where girls’ math scores are higher. Exercise. Some country names in one dataset don’t match those in the other one, for instance: Czech Republic vs. Czechia, Myanmar vs. Burma, etc. Resolve these conflicts as best you can. Click here for a solution. To get a list of the mismatched country names, we can call either: factbook$country[!(factbook$country %in% edstats$CountryName)] or: edstats$CountryName[!(edstats$CountryName %in% factbook$country)] Unfortunately, the data need to be cleaned manually – it’s a tedious task. The following consists of what we hope are the best matches between the two datasets (yet, the list is not perfect; in particular, the Republic of North Macedonia is completely missing in one of the datasets): from_to &lt;- matrix(ncol=2, byrow=TRUE, c( # FROM (edstats) # TO (factbook) &quot;Brunei Darussalam&quot; , &quot;Brunei&quot; , &quot;Congo, Dem.

Merge (join) the two datasets based on the country names. Click here for a solution. This can be done by means of the merge() function. edbook &lt;- merge(edstats, factbook, by.x=&quot;CountryName&quot;, by.y=&quot;country&quot;) ncol(edbook) # how many columns we have now ## [1] 157 Exercise. Learn a decision tree that distinguishes between the countries where girls are better at maths than boys and assess the quality of this classifier. Click here for a solution. We proceed as in one of the previous exercises: edbook$girls_rule_maths &lt;- factor(as.numeric( edbook$LO.PISA.MAT.FE&gt;edbook$LO.PISA.MAT.MA )) edbook_subset &lt;- edbook[!(names(edbook) %in% c(&quot;CountryName&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.MAT.FE&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.MAT.MA&quot;))] Fitting and plotting (see Figure 4.12): library(&quot;rpart&quot;) library(&quot;rpart.plot&quot;) tree &lt;- rpart(girls_rule_maths~., data=edbook_subset, method=&quot;class&quot;, model=TRUE) rpart.plot(tree) Figure 4.12: Yet another decision tree explaining the girls_rule_maths variable Performance metrics: Y_pred &lt;- predict(tree, edbook_subset, type=&quot;class&quot;) get_metrics(Y_pred, edbook_subset$girls_rule_maths) ## Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP ## 0.82716 0.78261 0.66667 0.72000 49.00000 9.00000 5.00000 18.00000 The variables included in the model are: This is… not at all enlightening. Rest assured that experts in education or econometrics for whom we work in this (imaginary) project would raise many questions at this very point. Merely applying some computational procedure on a dataset doesn’t cut it; it’s too early to ask for a paycheque. Classifiers are just blind tools in our gentle yet firm hands; new questions are risen, new answers must be sought. Further explorations are of course left as an exercise to the kind reader. 4.4.4 EdStats – Fitting of Binary Logistic Regression Models In this task we’re going to consider the “wide” version of the EdStats dataset again: edstats &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/edstats_2019_wide.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) Let’s re-add the girls_rule_maths column just as in the previous exercise. Then, let’s create a subset of edstats that doesn’t include the country names as well as the boys’ and girls’ math scores. edstats$girls_rule_maths &lt;- factor(as.numeric( edstats$LO.PISA.MAT.FE&gt;edstats$LO.PISA.MAT.MA )) edstats_subset &lt;- edstats[!(names(edstats) %in% c(&quot;CountryName&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.MAT.FE&quot;, &quot;LO.PISA.MAT.MA&quot;))] Exercise.

Note that the fitted model is nicely interpretable: the lower the boys’ average result on the Reading Scale or the higher the country’s result on the Science Scale, the higher the probability for girls_rule_maths: example_X &lt;- data.frame( LO.PISA.REA.MA=c(475, 450, 475, 500), LO.PISA.SCI= c(525, 525, 550, 500) ) cbind(example_X, `Pr(Y=1)`=predict(f1, example_X, type=&quot;response&quot;)) ## LO.PISA.REA.MA LO.PISA.SCI Pr(Y=1) ## 1 475 525 0.703342 ## 2 450 525 0.955526 ## 3 475 550 0.939986 ## 4 500 500 0.038094 Exercise.

Recall that the probabilities are modelled by means of the logistic sigmoid function applied on the output of a linear combination of the dependent variables. Moreover, cross-entropy features a logarithm, and \\(\\log 0 = -\\infty\\). This can be due to the fact that all the variables in the model are very correlated with each other (multicollinearity; an ill-conditioned problem). The obtained solution might be unstable – there might be many local optima and hence, different parameter vectors might be equally good. Moreover, it is likely that a small change in one of the inputs might lead to large change in the estimated model (* normally, we would attack this problem by employing some regularisation techniques). Of course, the model’s performance metrics can still be computed, but then it’s better if we treat it as a black box. Or, even better, reduce the number of independent variables and come up with a simpler model that serves its purpose better than this one.

Our dataset has too many missing values, and those cannot be present in a logistic regression model (it’s based on a linear combination of variables, and sums/products involving NAs yield NAs…). Looking at the manual of ?step, we see that the default NA handling is via na.omit(), and that, when applied on a data frame, results in the removal of all the rows, where there is at least one NA. Sadly, it’s too invasive. We should get rid of the data blanks manually. First, definitely, we should remove all the rows where girls_rule_maths is unknown: edstats_subset &lt;- edstats_subset[!is.na(edstats_subset$girls_rule_maths),] We are about to apply the forward selection process, whose purpose is to choose variables for a model. Therefore, instead of removing any more rows, we should remove the… columns with missing data: edstats_subset &lt;- edstats_subset[,colSums(sapply(edstats_subset, is.na))==0] (*) Alternatively, we could apply some techniques of missing data imputation; this is beyond the scope of this book. For instance, NAs could be replaced by the averages of their respective columns.

Interestingly, in the next chapter we will note that the logistic regression model is a special case of a feed-forward single layer neural network. We will also generalise the binary logistic regression to the case of a multiclass classification. The state-of-the art classifiers called Random Forests and XGBoost (see also: AdaBoost) are based on decision trees. They tend to be more accurate but – at the same time – they fail to exhibit the decision trees’ important feature: interpretability. Trees can also be used for regression tasks, see R package rpart. 4.5.2 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (James et al. 2017: Chapters 4 and 8) Other: (Hastie et al. 2017: Chapters 4 and 7 as well as (*) Chapters 9, 10, 13, 15) References "],

I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. 5.1 Introduction 5.1.1 Binary Logistic Regression: Recap Let \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) be an input matrix that consists of \\(n\\) points in a \\(p\\)-dimensional space. \\[ \\mathbf{X}= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{1,1} &amp; x_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1,p} \\\\ x_{2,1} &amp; x_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2,p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_{n,1} &amp; x_{n,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{n,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] In other words, we have a database on \\(n\\) objects. Each object is described by means of \\(p\\) numerical features. With each input \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) we associate the desired output \\(y_i\\) which is a categorical label – hence we will be dealing with classification tasks again. To recall, in binary logistic regression we model the probabilities that a given input belongs to either of the two classes: \\[ \\begin{array}{lr} \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=&amp; \\phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)\\\\ \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=&amp; 1-\\phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)\\\\ \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\phi(t) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}=\\frac{e^t}{1+e^t}\\) is the logistic sigmoid function. It holds: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}},\\\\ \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1+e^{+(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}}=\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] The fitting of the model was performed by minimising the cross-entropy (log-loss): \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p+1}} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\Bigg(y_i\\log \\hat{y}_i + (1-y_i)\\log (1-\\hat{y}_i)\\Bigg). \\] where \\(\\hat{y}_i=\\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta)\\). This is equivalent to: \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p+1}} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\Bigg(y_i\\log \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta) + (1-y_i)\\log \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta)\\Bigg). \\] Note that for each \\(i\\), either the left or the right term (in the bracketed expression) vanishes. Hence, we may also write the above as: \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p+1}} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\boldsymbol\\beta). \\] In this chapter we will generalise the binary logistic regression model: First we will consider the case of many classes (multiclass classification). This will lead to the multinomial logistic regression model. Then we will note that the multinomial logistic regression is a special case of a feed-forward neural network. 5.1.2 Data We will study the famous classic – the MNIST image classification dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database), see http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ It consists of 28×28 pixel images of handwritten digits: train: 60,000 training images, t10k: 10,000 testing images. A few image instances from each class are depicted in Figure 5.1. Figure 5.1: Example images in the MNIST database There are 10 unique digits, so this is a multiclass classification problem. Remark. The dataset is already “too easy” for testing of the state-of-the-art classifiers (see the notes below), but it’s a great educational example. Accessing MNIST via the keras package (which we will use throughout this chapter anyway) is easy: library(&quot;keras&quot;) mnist &lt;- dataset_mnist() X_train &lt;- mnist$train$x Y_train &lt;- mnist$train$y X_test &lt;- mnist$test$x Y_test &lt;- mnist$test$y X_train and X_test consist of 28×28 pixel images. dim(X_train) ## [1] 60000 28 28 dim(X_test) ## [1] 10000 28 28 X_train and X_test are 3-dimensional arrays, think of them as vectors of 60000 and 10000 matrices of size 28×28, respectively. These are grey-scale images, with 0 = black, …, 255 = white: range(X_train) ## [1] 0 255 Numerically, it’s more convenient to work with colour values converted to 0.0 = black, …, 1.0 = white: X_train &lt;- X_train/255 X_test &lt;- X_test/255 Y_train and Y_test are the corresponding integer labels: length(Y_train) ## [1] 60000 length(Y_test) ## [1] 10000 table(Y_train) # label distribution in the training sample ## Y_train ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 5923 6742 5958 6131 5842 5421 5918 6265 5851 5949 table(Y_test) # label distribution in the test sample ## Y_test ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 980 1135 1032 1010 982 892 958 1028 974 1009 Here is how we can plot one of the digits (see Figure 5.2): id &lt;- 123 # image ID to show image(z=t(X_train[id,,]), col=grey.colors(256, 0, 1), axes=FALSE, asp=1, ylim=c(1, 0)) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, bg=&quot;white&quot;, legend=sprintf(&quot;True label=%d&quot;, Y_train[id])) Figure 5.2: Example image from the MNIST dataset 5.2 Multinomial Logistic Regression 5.2.1 A Note on Data Representation So… you may now be wondering “how do we construct an image classifier, this seems so complicated!”. For a computer, (almost) everything is just numbers. Instead of playing with \\(n\\) matrices, each of size 28×28, we may “flatten” the images so as to get \\(n\\) “long” vectors of length \\(p=784\\). X_train2 &lt;- matrix(X_train, ncol=28*28) X_test2 &lt;- matrix(X_test, ncol=28*28) The classifiers studied here do not take the “spatial” positioning of the pixels into account anyway. Hence, now we’re back to our “comfort zone”. Remark. (*) See, however, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), e.g., in (Goodfellow et al. 2016). 5.2.2 Extending Logistic Regression Let us generalise the binary logistic regression model to a 10-class one (or, more generally, \\(K\\)-class one). This time we will be modelling ten probabilities, with \\(\\Pr(Y=k|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})\\) denoting the confidence that a given image \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is in fact the \\(k\\)-th digit: \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\dots\\\\ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\dots\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ \\Pr(Y=9|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\dots\\\\ \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the set of underlying model parameters (to be determined soon). In binary logistic regression, the class probabilities are obtained by “cleverly normalising” (by means of the logistic sigmoid) the outputs of a linear model (so that we obtain a value in \\([0,1]\\)). \\[ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\beta)=\\phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}} \\] In the multinomial case, we can use a separate linear model for each digit so that each \\(\\Pr(Y=k|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})\\), \\(k=0,1,\\dots,9\\), is given as a function of: \\[\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_{p}.\\] Therefore, instead of a parameter vector of length \\((p+1)\\), we will need a parameter matrix of size \\((p+1)\\times 10\\) representing the model’s definition. Side note. The upper case of \\(\\beta\\) is \\(B\\). Then, these 10 numbers will have to be normalised so as to they are all greater than \\(0\\) and sum to \\(1\\). To maintain the spirit of the original model, we can apply \\(e^{-(\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_{p})}\\) to get a positive value, because the co-domain of the exponential function \\(t\\mapsto e^t\\) is \\((0,\\infty)\\). Then, dividing each output by the sum of all the outputs will guarantee that the total sum equals 1. This leads to: \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} \\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_{0,0} + \\beta_{1,0} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,0} X_{p})}}{\\sum_{k=0}^9 e^{-(\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_p)}},\\\\ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_{0,1} + \\beta_{1,1} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,1} X_{p})}}{\\sum_{k=0}^9 e^{-(\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_{p})}},\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ \\Pr(Y=9|\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_{0,9} + \\beta_{1,9} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,9} X_{p})}}{\\sum_{k=0}^9 e^{-(\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} X_{1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} X_{p})}}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] This reduces to the binary logistic regression if we consider only the classes \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) and fix \\(\\beta_{0,0}=\\beta_{1,0}=\\dots=\\beta_{p,0}=0\\) (as \\(e^0=1\\)). 5.2.3 Softmax Function The above transformation (that maps 10 arbitrary real numbers to positive ones that sum to 1) is called the softmax function (or softargmax). softmax &lt;- function(T) { T2 &lt;- exp(T) # ignore the minus sign above T2/sum(T2) } round(rbind( softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)), softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0)), softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0)), softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 8))), 2) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] 0 0 1.00 0 0 0 0.00 0 0 0.00 ## [2,] 0 0 0.50 0 0 0 0.50 0 0 0.00 ## [3,] 0 0 0.73 0 0 0 0.27 0 0 0.00 ## [4,] 0 0 0.67 0 0 0 0.24 0 0 0.09 5.2.4 One-Hot Encoding and Decoding The ten class-belongingness-degrees can be decoded to obtain a single label by simply choosing the class that is assigned the highest probability. y_pred &lt;- softmax(c(0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 8)) round(y_pred, 2) # probabilities of Y=0, 1, 2, ..., 9 ## [1] 0.00 0.00 0.67 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.24 0.00 0.00 0.09 which.max(y_pred)-1 # 1..10 -&gt; 0..9 ## [1] 2 Remark. which.max(y) returns an index k such that y[k]==max(y) (recall that in R the first element in a vector is at index 1). Mathematically, we denote this operation as \\(\\mathrm{arg}\\max_{k=1,\\dots,K} y_k\\). To make processing the outputs of a logistic regression model more convenient, we will apply the so-called one-hot-encoding of the labels. Here, each label will be represented as a 0-1 vector of 10 probabilities – with probability 1 corresponding to the true class only. For instance: y &lt;- 2 # true class (this is just an example) y2 &lt;- rep(0, 10) y2[y+1] &lt;- 1 # +1 because we need 0..9 -&gt; 1..10 y2 # one-hot-encoded y ## [1] 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 To one-hot encode all the reference outputs in R, we start with a matrix of size \\(n\\times 10\\) populated with “0”s: Y_train2 &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=length(Y_train), ncol=10) Next, for every \\(i\\), we insert a “1” in the \\(i\\)-th row and the (Y_train[\\(i\\)]+1)-th column: # Note the &quot;+1&quot; 0..9 -&gt; 1..10 Y_train2[cbind(1:length(Y_train), Y_train+1)] &lt;- 1 Remark. In R, indexing a matrix A with a 2-column matrix B, i.e., A[B], allows for an easy access to A[B[1,1], B[1,2]], A[B[2,1], B[2,2]], A[B[3,1], B[3,2]], … Sanity check: head(Y_train) ## [1] 5 0 4 1 9 2 head(Y_train2) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## [4,] 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ## [6,] 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Let us generalise the above idea and write a function that can one-hot-encode any vector of integer labels: one_hot_encode &lt;- function(Y) { stopifnot(is.numeric(Y)) c1 &lt;- min(Y) # first class label cK &lt;- max(Y) # last class label K &lt;- cK-c1+1 # number of classes Y2 &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=length(Y), ncol=K) Y2[cbind(1:length(Y), Y-c1+1)] &lt;- 1 Y2 } Encode Y_train and Y_test: Y_train2 &lt;- one_hot_encode(Y_train) Y_test2 &lt;- one_hot_encode(Y_test) 5.2.5 Cross-entropy Revisited Our classifier will be outputting \\(K=10\\) probabilities. The true class labels are not one-hot-encoded so that they are represented as vectors of \\(K-1\\) zeros and a single one. How to measure the “agreement” between these two? In essence, we will be comparing the probability vectors as generated by a classifier, \\(\\hat{Y}\\): round(y_pred, 2) ## [1] 0.00 0.00 0.67 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.24 0.00 0.00 0.09 with the one-hot-encoded true probabilities, \\(Y\\): y2 ## [1] 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 It turns out that one of the definitions of cross-entropy introduced above already handles the case of multiclass classification: \\[ E(\\mathbf{B}) = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B}). \\] The smaller the probability corresponding to the ground-truth class outputted by the classifier, the higher the penalty, see Figure 5.3. Figure 5.3: The less the classifier is confident about the prediction of the actually true label, the greater the penalty To sum up, we will be solving the optimisation problem: \\[ \\min_{\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{(p+1)\\times 10}} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B}). \\] This has no analytical solution, but can be solved using iterative methods (see the chapter on optimisation). (*) Side note: A single term in the above formula, \\[ \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B}) \\] given: y_pred – a vector of 10 probabilities generated by the model: \\[ \\left[\\Pr(Y=0|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})\\ \\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})\\ \\cdots\\ \\Pr(Y=9|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})\\right] \\] y2 – a one-hot-encoded version of the true label, \\(y_i\\), of the form: \\[ \\left[0\\ 0\\ \\cdots\\ 0\\ 1\\ 0\\ \\cdots\\ 0\\right] \\] can be computed as: sum(y2*log(y_pred)) ## [1] -0.40782 5.2.6 Problem Formulation in Matrix Form (**) The definition of a multinomial logistic regression model for a multiclass classification task involving classes \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,K\\}\\) is slightly bloated. Assuming that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) is the input matrix, to compute the \\(K\\) predicted probabilities for the \\(i\\)-th input, \\[ \\left[ \\hat{y}_{i,1}\\ \\hat{y}_{i,2}\\ \\cdots\\ \\hat{y}_{i,K} \\right], \\] given a parameter matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}^{(p+1)\\times K}\\), we apply: \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} \\hat{y}_{i,1}=\\Pr(Y=1|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{\\beta_{0,1} + \\beta_{1,1} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,1} x_{i,p}}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K e^{\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} x_{i,p}}},\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ \\hat{y}_{i,K}=\\Pr(Y=K|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{B})&amp;=&amp;\\displaystyle\\frac{e^{\\beta_{0,K} + \\beta_{1,K} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,K} x_{i,p}}}{\\sum_{k=1}^K e^{\\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,k} x_{i,p}}}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] Remark. We have dropped the minus sign in the exponentiation for brevity of notation. Note that we can always map \\(b_{j,k}&#39;=-b_{j,k}\\). It turns out we can make use of matrix notation to tidy the above formulas. Denote the linear combinations prior to computing the softmax function with: \\[ \\begin{array}{lcl} t_{i,1}&amp;=&amp;\\beta_{0,1} + \\beta_{1,1} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,1} x_{i,p},\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ t_{i,K}&amp;=&amp;\\beta_{0,K} + \\beta_{1,K} x_{i,1} + \\dots + \\beta_{p,K} x_{i,p}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] We have: \\(x_{i,j}\\) – the \\(i\\)-th observation, the \\(j\\)-th feature; \\(\\hat{y}_{i,k}\\) – the \\(i\\)-th observation, the \\(k\\)-th class probability; \\(\\beta_{j,k}\\) – the coefficient for the \\(j\\)-th feature when computing the \\(k\\)-th class. Note that by augmenting \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{X}}=[\\boldsymbol{1}\\ \\mathbf{X}]\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times (p+1)}\\) by adding a column of 1s, i.e., where \\(\\dot{x}_{i,0}=1\\) and \\(\\dot{x}_{i,j}=x_{i,j}\\) for all \\(j\\ge 1\\) and all \\(i\\), we can write the above as: \\[ \\begin{array}{lclcl} t_{i,1}&amp;=&amp;\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j}\\, \\beta_{j,1} &amp;=&amp; \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{i,\\cdot}\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta_{\\cdot,1},\\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ t_{i,K}&amp;=&amp;\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j}\\, \\beta_{j,K} &amp;=&amp; \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{i,\\cdot}\\, \\boldsymbol\\beta_{\\cdot,K}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] We can get the \\(K\\) linear combinations all at once in the form of a row vector by writing: \\[ \\left[ t_{i,1}\\ t_{i,2}\\ \\cdots\\ t_{i,K} \\right] = {\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}}\\, \\mathbf{B}. \\] Moreover, we can do that for all the \\(n\\) inputs by writing: \\[ \\mathbf{T}=\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\,\\mathbf{B}. \\] Yes yes yes! This is a single matrix multiplication, we have \\(\\mathbf{T}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times K}\\). To obtain \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\), we have to apply the softmax function on every row of \\(\\mathbf{T}\\): \\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}=\\mathrm{softmax}\\left( \\dot{\\mathbf{X}}\\,\\mathbf{B} \\right). \\] That’s it. Take some time to appreciate the elegance of this notation. Methods for minimising cross-entropy expressed in matrix form will be discussed in the next chapter. 5.3 Artificial Neural Networks 5.3.1 Artificial Neuron A neuron can be thought of as a mathematical function, see Figure 5.4, which has its specific inputs and an output. Figure 5.4: Neuron as a mathematical (black box) function; image based on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Neuron3.png by Egm4313.s12 at English Wikipedia, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license The Linear Threshold Unit (McCulloch and Pitts, 1940s), the Perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958) and the Adaptive Linear Neuron (Widrow and Hoff, 1960) were amongst the first models of an artificial neuron that could be used for the purpose of pattern recognition, see Figure 5.5. They can be thought of as processing units that compute a weighted sum of the inputs, which is then transformed by means of a nonlinear “activation” function. Figure 5.5: A simple model of an artificial neuron 5.3.2 Logistic Regression as a Neural Network The above resembles our binary logistic regression model, where we determine a linear combination (a weighted sum) of \\(p\\) inputs and then transform it using the logistic sigmoid “activation” function. We can easily depict it in the Figure 5.4-style, see Figure 5.6. Figure 5.6: Binary logistic regression On the other hand, a multiclass logistic regression can be depicted as in Figure 5.7. In fact, we can consider it as an instance of a: single layer (there is only one processing step that consists of 10 units), densely connected (all the inputs are connected to all the components below), feed-forward (the outputs are generated by processing the inputs from “top” to “bottom”, there are no loops in the graph etc.) artificial neural network that uses the softmax as the activation function. Figure 5.7: Multinomial logistic regression 5.3.3 Example in R To train such a neural network (i.e., fit a multinomial logistic regression model), we will use the keras package, a wrapper around the (GPU-enabled) TensorFlow library. The training of the model takes a few minutes (for more complex models and bigger datasets – it could take hours/days). Thus, it is wise to store the computed model (the \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) coefficient matrix and the accompanying keras’s auxiliary data) for further reference: file_name &lt;- &quot;datasets/mnist_keras_model1.h5&quot; if (!file.exists(file_name)) { # File doesn&#39;t exist -&gt; compute set.seed(123) # Start with an empty model model1 &lt;- keras_model_sequential() # Add a single layer with 10 units and softmax activation layer_dense(model1, units=10, activation=&quot;softmax&quot;) # We will be minimising the cross-entropy, # sgd == stochastic gradient descent, see the next chapter compile(model1, optimizer=&quot;sgd&quot;, loss=&quot;categorical_crossentropy&quot;) # Fit the model (slooooow!) fit(model1, X_train2, Y_train2, epochs=10) # Save the model for future reference save_model_hdf5(model1, file_name) } else { # File exists -&gt; reload the model model1 &lt;- load_model_hdf5(file_name) } Let’s make predictions over the test set: Y_pred2 &lt;- predict(model1, X_test2) round(head(Y_pred2), 2) # predicted class probabilities ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## [1,] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 ## [2,] 0.01 0.00 0.93 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.04 0.00 0.00 0.00 ## [3,] 0.00 0.96 0.02 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 ## [4,] 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 ## [5,] 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.91 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.05 ## [6,] 0.00 0.98 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 Then, we can one-hot-decode the output probabilities: Y_pred &lt;- apply(Y_pred2, 1, which.max)-1 # 1..10 -&gt; 0..9 head(Y_pred, 20) # predicted outputs ## [1] 7 2 1 0 4 1 4 9 6 9 0 6 9 0 1 5 9 7 3 4 head(Y_test, 20) # true outputs ## [1] 7 2 1 0 4 1 4 9 5 9 0 6 9 0 1 5 9 7 3 4 Accuracy on the test set: mean(Y_test == Y_pred) ## [1] 0.9169 Performance metrics for each digit separately (see also Figure 5.8): i Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP 0 0.9924 0.94664 0.97755 0.96185 8966 22 54 958 1 0.9923 0.95920 0.97357 0.96633 8818 30 47 1105 2 0.9803 0.92214 0.88372 0.90252 8891 120 77 912 3 0.9802 0.89417 0.91188 0.90294 8881 89 109 921 4 0.9833 0.90148 0.93177 0.91637 8918 67 100 915 5 0.9793 0.91415 0.84753 0.87958 9037 136 71 756 6 0.9885 0.93142 0.94990 0.94057 8975 48 67 910 7 0.9834 0.92843 0.90856 0.91839 8900 94 72 934 8 0.9754 0.86473 0.88604 0.87525 8891 111 135 863 9 0.9787 0.90040 0.88702 0.89366 8892 114 99 895 Note how misleading the individual accuracies are!

We could try aligning neurons into many interconnected layers. This leads to a structure like the one in Figure 5.9. Figure 5.9: A multi-layer neural network 5.4.2 Activation Functions Each layer’s outputs should be transformed by some non-linear activation function. Otherwise, we’d end up with linear combinations of linear combinations, which are linear combinations themselves. Example activation functions that can be used in hidden (inner) layers: relu – The rectified linear unit: \\[\\psi(t)=\\max(t, 0),\\] sigmoid – The logistic sigmoid: \\[\\phi(t)= \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-t)},\\] tanh – The hyperbolic function: \\[\\mathrm{tanh}(t) = \\frac{\\exp(t) - \\exp(-t)}{\\exp(t) + \\exp(-t)}.\\] There is not much difference between them, but some might be more convenient to handle numerically than the others, depending on the implementation. 5.4.3 Example in R - 2 Layers Let’s construct a 2-layer Neural Network of the type 784-800-10: file_name &lt;- &quot;datasets/mnist_keras_model2.h5&quot; if (!file.exists(file_name)) { set.seed(123) model2 &lt;- keras_model_sequential() layer_dense(model2, units=800, activation=&quot;relu&quot;) layer_dense(model2, units=10, activation=&quot;softmax&quot;) compile(model2, optimizer=&quot;sgd&quot;, loss=&quot;categorical_crossentropy&quot;) fit(model2, X_train2, Y_train2, epochs=10) save_model_hdf5(model2, file_name) } else { model2 &lt;- load_model_hdf5(file_name) } Y_pred2 &lt;- predict(model2, X_test2) Y_pred &lt;- apply(Y_pred2, 1, which.max)-1 # 1..10 -&gt; 0..9 mean(Y_test == Y_pred) # accuracy on the test set ## [1] 0.9583 Performance metrics for each digit separately, see also Figure 5.10: i Acc Prec Rec F TN FN FP TP 0 0.9948 0.96215 0.98571 0.97379 8982 14 38 966 1 0.9962 0.98156 0.98502 0.98329 8844 17 21 1118 2 0.9911 0.96000 0.95349 0.95673 8927 48 41 984 3 0.9898 0.94773 0.95149 0.94960 8937 49 53 961 4 0.9919 0.95829 0.95927 0.95878 8977 40 41 942 5 0.9911 0.95470 0.94507 0.94986 9068 49 40 843 6 0.9920 0.94888 0.96868 0.95868 8992 30 50 928 7 0.9906 0.95517 0.95331 0.95424 8926 48 46 980 8 0.9899 0.95421 0.94148 0.94780 8982 57 44 917 9 0.9892 0.95643 0.93558 0.94589 8948 65 43 944 Figure 5.10: Performance metrics for a 2-layer net 784-800-10 [relu] on MNIST 5.4.4 Example in R - 6 Layers How about a 6-layer Deep Neural Network like 784-2500-2000-1500-1000-500-10?

Test the performance of different neural network architectures (different number of layers, different number of neurons in each layer etc.). Yes, it’s more art than science! Many tried to come up with various “rules of thumb”, see, for example, the comp.ai.neural-nets FAQ (Sarle &amp; others 2002) at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part3/preamble.html, but what works well in one problem might not be generalisable to another one. 5.5 Preprocessing of Data 5.5.1 Introduction Do not underestimate the power of appropriate data preprocessing — deep neural networks are not a universal replacement for a data engineer’s hard work! On top of that, they are not interpretable – these are merely black-boxes. Among the typical transformations of the input images we can find: normalisation of colours (setting brightness, stretching contrast, etc.), repositioning of the image (centring), deskewing (see below), denoising (e.g., by blurring). Another frequently applied technique concerns an expansion of the training data — we can add “artificially contaminated” images to the training set (e.g., slightly rotated digits) so as to be more ready to whatever will be provided in the test test. 5.5.2 Image Deskewing Deskewing of images (“straightening” of the digits) is amongst the most typical transformations that can be applied on MNIST. Unfortunately, we don’t have (yet) the necessary mathematical background to discuss this operation in very detail. Luckily, we can apply it on each image anyway. See the GitHub repository at https://github.com/gagolews/Playground.R for an example notebook and the deskew.R script. # See https://github.com/gagolews/Playground.R source(&quot;~/R/Playground.R/deskew.R&quot;) # new_image &lt;- deskew(old_image) Figure 5.12: Deskewing of the MNIST digits Let’s take a look at Figure 5.12. In each pair, the left image (black background) is the original one, and the right image (palette inverted for purely dramatic effects) is its deskewed version. Below we deskew each image in the training as well as in the test sample. This also takes a long time, so let’s store the resulting objects for further reference: file_name &lt;- &quot;datasets/mnist_deskewed_train.rds&quot; if (!file.exists(file_name)) { Z_train &lt;- X_train for (i in 1:dim(Z_train)[1]) { Z_train[i,,] &lt;- deskew(Z_train[i,,]) } Z_train2 &lt;- matrix(Z_train, ncol=28*28) saveRDS(Z_train2, file_name) } else { Z_train2 &lt;- readRDS(file_name) } file_name &lt;- &quot;datasets/mnist_deskewed_test.rds&quot; if (!file.exists(file_name)) { Z_test &lt;- X_test for (i in 1:dim(Z_test)[1]) { Z_test[i,,] &lt;- deskew(Z_test[i,,]) } Z_test2 &lt;- matrix(Z_test, ncol=28*28) saveRDS(Z_test2, file_name) } else { Z_test2 &lt;- readRDS(file_name) } Remark.

Figure 5.15: A heat map of F-measures for each classified digit and each method 5.6 Outro 5.6.1 Remarks We have discussed a multinomial logistic regression model as a generalisation of the binary one. This in turn is a special case of feed-forward neural networks. There’s a lot of hype (again…) for deep neural networks in many applications, including vision, self-driving cars, natural language processing, speech recognition etc. Many different architectures of neural networks and types of units are being considered in theory and in practice, e.g.: convolutional neural networks apply a series of signal (e.g., image) transformations in first layers, they might actually “discover” deskewing automatically etc.; recurrent neural networks can imitate long/short-term memory that can be used for speech synthesis and time series prediction. Main drawbacks of deep neural networks: learning is very slow, especially with very deep architectures (days, weeks); models are not explainable (black boxes) and hard to debug; finding good architectures is more art than science (maybe: more of a craftsmanship even); sometimes using deep neural network is just an excuse for being too lazy to do proper data cleansing and pre-processing. There are many issues and challenges that are tackled in more advanced AI/ML courses and books, such as (Goodfellow et al. 2016). 5.6.2 Beyond MNIST The MNIST dataset is a classic, although its use in deep learning research is nowadays discouraged – the dataset is not considered challenging anymore – state of the art classifiers can reach \\(99.8\\%\\) accuracy. See Zalando’s Fashion-MNIST (by Kashif Rasul &amp; Han Xiao) at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist for a modern replacement. Alternatively, take a look at CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) by A. Krizhevsky et al. or at ImageNet (http://image-net.org/index) for an even greater challenge. 5.6.3 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (James et al. 2017: Chapter 11), (Sarle &amp; others 2002) and (Goodfellow et al. 2016) See also the keras package tutorials available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/keras/index.html and https://keras.rstudio.com.

There will be not much work on-going in this repository anymore, as its sources have moved elsewhere; however, if you happen to find any bugs or typos, please drop me an email. I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. 6.1 Introduction 6.1.1 Optimisation Problems Mathematical optimisation (a.k.a. mathematical programming) deals with the study of algorithms to solve problems related to selecting the best element amongst the set of available alternatives. Most frequently “best” is expressed in terms of an error or goodness of fit measure: \\[ f:\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{R} \\] called an objective function, where \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) is the search space (problem domain, feasible set). An optimisation task deals with finding an element \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}\\) amongst the set of possible candidate solutions, that minimises or maximises \\(f\\): \\[ \\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}} f(\\mathbf{x}) \\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\max_{\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}} f(\\mathbf{x}), \\] In this chapter we will deal with unconstrained continuous optimisation, i.e., we will assume the search space is \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\mathbb{R}^p\\) for some \\(p\\) – we’ll be optimising over \\(p\\) real-valued parameters. 6.1.2 Example Optimisation Problems in Machine Learning In multiple linear regression we were minimising the sum of squared residuals \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^p} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p} - y_i \\right)^2. \\] In binary logistic regression we were minimising the cross-entropy: \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^p} -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\begin{array}{r} y_i \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}}} \\right)\\\\ + (1-y_i)\\log \\left(\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p}}}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i,1}+\\dots+\\beta_p x_{i,p})}}\\right) \\end{array}\\right). \\] 6.1.3 Types of Minima and Maxima Note that minimising \\(f\\) is the same as maximising \\(\\bar{f}=-f\\). In other words, \\(\\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}} f(\\mathbf{x})\\) and \\(\\max_{\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}} -f(\\mathbf{x})\\) represent the same optimisation problems (and hence have identical solutions). Definition. A minimum of \\(f\\) is a point \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) such that \\(f(\\mathbf{x}^*)\\le f(\\mathbf{x})\\) for all \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}\\). On the other hand, a maximum of \\(f\\) is a point \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) such that \\(f(\\mathbf{x}^*)\\ge f(\\mathbf{x})\\) for all \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}\\). Assuming that \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\mathbb{R}\\), Figure 6.1 shows an example objective function, \\(f:\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), that has a minimum at \\({x}^*=1\\) with \\(f(x^*)=-2\\). Figure 6.1: A function with the global minimum at \\({x}^*=1\\) Remark. We can denote these two facts as follows: \\((\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}} f(x))=-2\\) (value of \\(f\\) at the minimum is \\(-2\\)), \\((\\mathrm{arg}\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}} f(x))=1\\) (location of the minimum, i.e., argument minimum, is \\(1\\)). By definition, a minimum/maximum might not necessarily be unique. This depends on a problem. Assuming that \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\mathbb{R}\\), Figure 6.2 gives an example objective function, \\(f:\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), that has multiple minima; every \\({x}^*\\in[1-\\sqrt{2},1+\\sqrt{2}]\\) yields \\(f(x^*)=0\\). Figure 6.2: A function that has multiple minima Remark. If this was the case of some machine learning problem, it would mean that we could have many equally well-performing models, and hence many equivalent explanations of the same phenomenon. Moreover, it may happen that a function has multiple local minima, compare Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: A function with two local minima Definition. We say that \\(f\\) has a local minimum at \\(\\mathbf{x}^+\\in \\mathbb{D}\\), if for some neighbourhood \\(B(\\mathbf{x}^+)\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}^+\\) it holds \\(f(\\mathbf{x}^+) \\le f(\\mathbf{x})\\) for each \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in B(\\mathbf{x}^+)\\). If \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\mathbb{R}\\), by neighbourhood \\(B(x)\\) of \\(x\\) we mean an open interval centred at \\(x\\) of width \\(2r\\) for some small \\(r&gt;0\\), i.e., \\((x-r, x+r)\\) Definition. (*) If \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\mathbb{R}^p\\) (for any \\(p\\ge 1\\)), by neighbourhood \\(B(\\mathbf{x})\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) we mean an open ball centred at \\(\\mathbf{x}^+\\) of some small radius \\(r&gt;0\\), i.e., \\(\\{\\mathbf{y}: \\|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}\\|&lt;r\\}\\) (read: the set of all the points with Euclidean distances to \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) less than \\(r\\)). To avoid ambiguity, the “true” minimum (a point \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) such that \\(f(\\mathbf{x}^*)\\le f({x})\\) for all \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}\\)) is sometimes also referred to as a global minimum. Remark. Of course, the global minimum is also a function’s local minimum. The existence of local minima is problematic as most of the optimisation methods might get stuck there and fail to return the global one. Moreover, we cannot often be sure if the result returned by an algorithm is indeed a global minimum. Maybe there exists a better solution that hasn’t been considered yet? Or maybe the function is very noisy (see Figure 6.4)? Figure 6.4: Smooth vs. non-smooth vs. noisy objective functions 6.1.4 Example Objective over a 2D Domain Of course, our objective function does not necessarily have to be defined over a one-dimensional domain. For example, consider the following function: \\[ g(x_1,x_2)=\\log\\left((x_1^{2}+x_2-5)^{2}+(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)^{2}+x_1^2-1.60644\\dots\\right) \\] g &lt;- function(x1, x2) log((x1^2+x2-5)^2+(x1+x2^2-3)^2+x1^2-1.60644366086443841) x1 &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out=100) x2 &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out=100) # outer() expands two vectors to form a 2D grid # and applies a given function on each point y &lt;- outer(x1, x2, g) There are four local minima: x1 x2 f(x1,x2) 2.2780 -0.61343 1.3564 -2.6123 -2.34546 1.7051 1.7988 1.19879 0.6955 -1.5423 2.15641 0.0000 The global minimum is at \\(\\mathbf{x}^*=(x_1^*, x_2^*)\\) as below: g(-1.542255693195422641930153, 2.156405289793087261832605) ## [1] 0 Let’s explore various ways of depicting \\(f\\) first. A contour plot and a heat map are given in Figure 6.5. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # 2 in 1 # lefthand plot: contour(x1, x2, y, nlevels=25) points(-1.54226, 2.15641, col=2, pch=3) # righthand plot: image(x1, x2, y) contour(x1, x2, y, add=TRUE) Figure 6.5: A contour plot and a heat map of \\(g(x_1,x_2)\\) Two perspective plots (views from different angles) are given in Figure 6.6. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # 2 in 1 persp(x1, x2, y, phi=30, theta=-5, shade=2, border=NA) persp(x1, x2, y, phi=30, theta=75, shade=2, border=NA) Figure 6.6: Perspective plots of \\(g(x_1,x_2)\\) Remark. As usual, depicting functions that are defined over high-dimensional (3D and higher) domains is… difficult. Usually 1D or 2D projections can give us some neat intuitions though. 6.2 Iterative Methods 6.2.1 Introduction Many optimisation algorithms are built around the following scheme: Starting from a random point, perform a walk, in each step deciding where to go based on the idea of where the location of the minimum might be. Example. Imagine we’re to cycle from Deakin University’s Burwood Campus to the CBD not knowing the route and with GPS disabled – we’ll have to ask many people along the way, but we’ll eventually (because most people are good) get to some CBD (say, in Perth). More formally, we are interested in iterative algorithms that operate in a greedy-like manner: \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}\\) – initial guess (e.g., generated at random) for \\(i=1,...,M\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)}+\\text{[guessed direction]}\\) if \\(|f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})-f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)})| &lt; \\varepsilon\\) break return \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\) as result Note that there are two stopping criteria, based on: \\(M\\) = maximum number of iterations, \\(\\varepsilon\\) = tolerance, e.g, \\(10^{-8}\\). 6.2.2 Example in R R has a built-in function, optim(), that provides an implementation of (amongst others) the BFGS method (proposed by Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno in 1970). Remark. (*) BFGS uses the assumption that the objective function is smooth – the [guessed direction] is determined by computing the (partial) derivatives (or their finite-difference approximations). However, they might work well even if this is not the case. We’ll be able to derive similar algorithms (called quasi-Newton ones) ourselves once we learn about Taylor series approximation by reading a book/taking a course on calculus. Here, we shall use the BFGS as a black-box continuous optimisation method, i.e., without going into how it has been defined (in terms of our assumed math skills, it might be too early for this). Despite that, will still be able to point out a few interesting patterns. optim(par, fn, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;) where: par – an initial guess (a numeric vector of length \\(p\\)) fn – an objective function to minimise (takes a vector of length \\(p\\) on input, returns a single number) Let us minimise the \\(g\\) function defined above (the one with the 2D domain): # g needs to be rewritten to accept a 2-ary vector g_vectorised &lt;- function(x12) g(x12[1], x12[2]) # random starting point with coordinates in [-5, 5] (x12_init &lt;- runif(2, -5, 5)) ## [1] -2.1242 2.8831 (res &lt;- optim(x12_init, g_vectorised, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;)) ## $par ## [1] -1.5423 2.1564 ## ## $value ## [1] 1.4131e-12 ## ## $counts ## function gradient ## 101 21 ## ## $convergence ## [1] 0 ## ## $message ## NULL Note that: par gives the location of the local minimum found, value gives the value of \\(g\\) at par, convergence of 0 is a successful one (we were able to satisfy the \\(|f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})-f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)})| &lt; \\varepsilon\\) condition). We can even depict the points that the algorithm is “visiting”, see Figure 6.7. Remark. (*) Technically, the algorithm needs to evaluate a few more points in order to make the decision on where to go next (BFGS approximates the gradient and the Hessian matrix). g_vectorised_plot &lt;- function(x12) { points(x12[1], x12[2], col=2, pch=3) # draw g(x12[1], x12[2]) # return value } contour(x1, x2, y, nlevels=25) res &lt;- optim(x12_init, g_vectorised_plot, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;) Figure 6.7: Each plotting symbol marks a point where the objective function was evaluated by the BFGS method 6.2.3 Convergence to Local Optima We were lucky, because the local minimum that the algorithm has found coincides with the global minimum. Let’s see where does the BFGS algorithm converge if seek the minimum of the above \\(g\\) starting from many randomly chosen points uniformly distributed over the square \\([-5,5]\\times[-5,5]\\): res_value &lt;- replicate(1000, { # this will be iterated 100 times x12_init &lt;- runif(2, -5, 5) res &lt;- optim(x12_init, g_vectorised, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;) res$value # return value from each iteration }) table(round(res_value,3)) ## ## 0 0.695 1.356 1.705 ## 273 352 156 219 Unfortunately, we find the global minimum only in \\(\\sim 25\\%\\) cases, compare Figure 6.8. hist(res_value, col=&quot;white&quot;, breaks=100, main=NA); box() Figure 6.8: A histogram of the objective function’s value at the local minimum found when using a random initial guess Figure 6.9 depicts all the random starting points and where do we converge from them. Figure 6.9: Each line segment connect a starting point to the point of BFGS’s convergence; note that by starting in the neighbourhood of \\((0,-4)\\) we can actually end up in any of the 4 local minima 6.2.4 Random Restarts A kind of “remedy” for the above limitation could be provided by repeated local search: in order to robustify an optimisation procedure it is often advised to consider multiple random initial points and pick the best solution amongst the identified local optima. # N - number of restarts # par_generator - a function generating initial guesses # ... - further arguments to optim() optim_with_restarts &lt;- function(par_generator, ..., N=10) { res_best &lt;- list(value=Inf) # cannot be worse than this for (i in 1:N) { res &lt;- optim(par_generator(), ...) if (res$value &lt; res_best$value) res_best &lt;- res # a better candidate found } res_best } optim_with_restarts(function() runif(2, -5, 5), g_vectorised, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;, N=10) ## $par ## [1] -1.5423 2.1564 ## ## $value ## [1] 3.9702e-13 ## ## $counts ## function gradient ## 48 17 ## ## $convergence ## [1] 0 ## ## $message ## NULL Exercise. Food for thought: Can we really really guarantee that the global minimum will be found within \\(N\\) tries? Click here for a solution. Absolutely not. 6.3 Gradient Descent 6.3.1 Function Gradient (*) How to choose the [guessed direction] in our iterative optimisation algorithm? If we are minimising a smooth function, the simplest possible choice is to use the information included in the objective’s gradient, which provides us with the information about the direction where the function decreases the fastest. Definition. (*) Gradient of \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^p\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), denoted \\(\\nabla f:\\mathbb{R}^p\\to\\mathbb{R}^p\\), is the vector of all its partial derivatives, (\\(\\nabla\\) – nabla symbol = differential operator) \\[ \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(\\mathbf{x})\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_p}(\\mathbf{x}) \\end{array} \\right] \\] If we have a function \\(f(x_1,...,x_p)\\), the partial derivative w.r.t. the \\(i\\)-th variable, denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}\\) is like an ordinary derivative w.r.t. \\(x_i\\) where \\(x_1,...,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},...,x_p\\) are assumed constant. Remark. Function differentiation is an important concept – see how it’s referred to in, e.g., the keras package manual at https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/fit.html. Recall our \\(g\\) function defined above: \\[ g(x_1,x_2)=\\log\\left((x_1^{2}+x_2-5)^{2}+(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)^{2}+x_1^2-1.60644\\dots\\right) \\] It can be shown (*) that: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x_1}(x_1,x_2)=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{ 4x_1(x_1^{2}+x_2-5)+2(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)+2x_1 }{(x_1^{2}+x_2-5)^{2}+(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)^{2}+x_1^2-1.60644\\dots} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x_2}(x_1,x_2)=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{ 2(x_1^{2}+x_2-5)+4x_2(x_1+x_2^{2}-3) }{(x_1^{2}+x_2-5)^{2}+(x_1+x_2^{2}-3)^{2}+x_1^2-1.60644\\dots} \\end{array} \\] grad_g_vectorised &lt;- function(x) { c( 4*x[1]*(x[1]^2+x[2]-5)+2*(x[1]+x[2]^2-3)+2*x[1], 2*(x[1]^2+x[2]-5)+4*x[2]*(x[1]+x[2]^2-3) )/( (x[1]^2+x[2]-5)^2+(x[1]+x[2]^2-3)^2+x[1]^2-1.60644366086443841 ) } 6.3.2 Three Facts on the Gradient For now, we should emphasise three important facts: Fact 1. If we are incapable of deriving the gradient analytically, we can rely on its finite differences approximation. Each partial derivative can be estimated by means of: \\[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(x_1,\\dots,x_p) \\simeq \\frac{ f(x_1,...,x_i+\\delta,...,x_p)-f(x_1,...,x_i,...,x_p) }{ \\delta } \\] for some small \\(\\delta&gt;0\\), say, \\(\\delta=10^{-6}\\). Remark. (*) Actually, a function’s partial derivative, by definition, is the limit of the above as \\(\\delta\\to 0\\). Example implementation: # gradient of f at x=c(x[1],...,x[p]) grad_approx &lt;- function(f, x, delta=1e-6) { p &lt;- length(x) gf &lt;- numeric(p) # vector of length p for (i in 1:p) { xi &lt;- x xi[i] &lt;- xi[i]+delta gf[i] &lt;- f(xi) } (gf-f(x))/delta } Remark. (*) Interestingly, some modern vector/matrix algebra frameworks like TensorFlow (upon which keras is built) or PyTorch, feature methods to “derive” the gradient algorithmically (autodiff; automatic differentiation). Sanity check: grad_approx(g_vectorised, c(-2, 2)) ## [1] -3.1865 -1.3656 grad_g_vectorised(c(-2, 2)) ## [1] -3.1865 -1.3656 grad_approx(g_vectorised, c(-1.542255693, 2.15640528979)) ## [1] 1.0588e-05 1.9817e-05 grad_g_vectorised(c(-1.542255693, 2.15640528979)) ## [1] 4.1292e-09 3.5771e-10 By the way, there is also the grad() function in package numDeriv that might be a little more accurate (uses a different approximation formula). Fact 2. The gradient of \\(f\\) at \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\), is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest slope. On the other hand, minus gradient, \\(-\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\), is the direction where the function decreases the fastest. Remark. (*) This can be shown by considering a function’s first-order Taylor series approximation. Each gradient is a vector, therefore it can be depicted as an arrow. Figure 6.10 illustrates a few scaled gradients of the \\(g\\) function at different points – each arrow connects a point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{x}\\pm 0.1\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\). Figure 6.10: Scaled radients (pink arrows) and minus gradients (blue arrows) of \\(g(x_1,x_2)\\) at different points Note that the blue arrows point more or less in the direction of the local minimum. Therefore, in our iterative algorithm, we may try taking the direction of the minus gradient! How far should we go in that direction? Well, a bit. We will refer to the desired step size as the learning rate, \\(\\eta\\). This will be called the gradient descent method (GD; Cauchy, 1847). Fact 3. If a function \\(f\\) has a local minimum at \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\), then its gradient vanishes there, i.e., \\(\\nabla {f}(\\mathbf{x}^*)=[0,\\dots,0]\\). Note that the above condition is a necessary, not sufficient one. For example, the gradient also vanishes at a maximum or at a saddle point. In fact, we have what follows. Theorem. (***) More generally, a twice-differentiable function has a local minimum at \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) if and only if its gradient vanishes there and \\(\\nabla^2 {f}(\\mathbf{x}^*)\\) (Hessian matrix = matrix of all second-order derivatives) is positive-definite. 6.3.3 Gradient Descent Algorithm (GD) Taking the above into account, we arrive at the gradient descent algorithm: \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}\\) – initial guess (e.g., generated at random) for \\(i=1,...,M\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)}-\\eta \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)})\\) if \\(|f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})-f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)})| &lt; \\varepsilon\\) break return \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\) as result where \\(\\eta&gt;0\\) is a step size frequently referred to as the learning rate, because that’s much more cool. We usually set \\(\\eta\\) of small order of magnitude, say \\(0.01\\) or \\(0.1\\). An implementation of the gradient descent algorithm is straightforward. In essence, it’s the par &lt;- par - eta*grad_g_vectorised(par) expression run in a loop, until convergence. # par - initial guess # fn - a function to be minimised # gr - a function to return the gradient of fn # eta - learning rate # maxit - maximum number of iterations # tol - convergence tolerance optim_gd &lt;- function(par, fn, gr, eta=0.01, maxit=1000, tol=1e-8) { f_last &lt;- fn(par) for (i in 1:maxit) { par &lt;- par - eta*grad_g_vectorised(par) # update step f_cur &lt;- fn(par) if (abs(f_cur-f_last) &lt; tol) break f_last &lt;- f_cur } list( # see ?optim, section `Value` par=par, value=g_vectorised(par), counts=i, convergence=as.integer(i==maxit) ) } Tests of the \\(g\\) function. First, let’s try \\(\\eta=0.01\\). Figure 6.11 zooms in the contour plot so that we can see the actual path the algorithm has taken. eta &lt;- 0.01 res &lt;- optim_gd(c(-3, 1), g_vectorised, grad_g_vectorised, eta=eta) str(res) ## List of 4 ## $ par : num [1:2] -1.54 2.16 ## $ value : num 1.33e-08 ## $ counts : int 135 ## $ convergence: int 0 Figure 6.11: Path taken by the gradient descent algorithm with \\(\\eta=0.01\\) Now let’s try \\(\\eta=0.05\\). eta &lt;- 0.05 res &lt;- optim_gd(c(-3, 1), g_vectorised, grad_g_vectorised, eta=eta) str(res) ## List of 4 ## $ par : num [1:2] -1.54 2.15 ## $ value : num 0.000203 ## $ counts : int 417 ## $ convergence: int 0 With an increased step size, the algorithm needed many more iterations (3 times as many), see Figure 6.12 for the path taken. Figure 6.12: Path taken by the gradient descent algorithm with \\(\\eta=0.05\\) And now for something completely different: \\(\\eta=0.1\\), see Figure 6.13. eta &lt;- 0.1 res &lt;- optim_gd(c(-3, 1), g_vectorised, grad_g_vectorised, eta=eta) str(res) ## List of 4 ## $ par : num [1:2] -1.52 2.33 ## $ value : num 0.507 ## $ counts : int 1000 ## $ convergence: int 1 Figure 6.13: Path taken by the gradient descent algorithm with \\(\\eta=0.1\\) The algorithm failed to converge. If the learning rate \\(\\eta\\) is too small, the convergence might be too slow or we might get stuck at a plateau. On the other hand, if \\(\\eta\\) is too large, we might be overshooting and end up bouncing around the minimum. This is why many optimisation libraries (including keras/TensorFlow) implement some of the following ideas: learning rate decay – start with large \\(\\eta\\), decreasing it in every iteration, say, by some percent; line search – determine optimal \\(\\eta\\) in every step by solving a 1-dimensional optimisation problem w.r.t. \\(\\eta\\in[0,\\eta_{\\max}]\\); momentum – the update step is based on a combination of the gradient direction and the previous change of the parameters, \\(\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\); can be used to accelerate search in the relevant direction and minimise oscillations. Exercise. Try implementing at least the first of the above heuristics yourself. You can set eta &lt;- eta*0.95 in every iteration of the gradient descent procedure. 6.3.4 Example: MNIST (*) In the previous chapter we’ve studied the MNIST dataset. Let us go back to the task of fitting a multiclass logistic regression model. library(&quot;keras&quot;) mnist &lt;- dataset_mnist() # get train/test images in greyscale X_train &lt;- mnist$train$x/255 # to [0,1] X_test &lt;- mnist$test$x/255 # to [0,1] # get the corresponding labels in {0,1,...,9}: Y_train &lt;- mnist$train$y Y_test &lt;- mnist$test$y The labels need to be one-hot encoded: one_hot_encode &lt;- function(Y) { stopifnot(is.numeric(Y)) c1 &lt;- min(Y) # first class label cK &lt;- max(Y) # last class label K &lt;- cK-c1+1 # number of classes Y2 &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=length(Y), ncol=K) Y2[cbind(1:length(Y), Y-c1+1)] &lt;- 1 Y2 } Y_train2 &lt;- one_hot_encode(Y_train) Y_test2 &lt;- one_hot_encode(Y_test) Our task is to find the parameters \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) that minimise cross entropy \\(E(\\mathbf{B})\\) over the training set: \\[ \\min_{\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{785\\times 10}} -\\frac{1}{n^\\text{train}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n^\\text{train}} \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i^\\text{train}|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}^\\text{train},\\mathbf{B}). \\] In the previous chapter, we’ve relied on the methods implemented in the keras package. Let’s do that all by ourselves now. In order to come up with a working version of the gradient descent procedure for classifying of MNIST digits, we will need to derive and implement grad_cross_entropy(). We do that below using matrix notation. Remark. In the first reading, you can jump to the Safe landing zone below with no much loss in what we’re trying to convey here (you will then treat grad_cross_entropy() as a black-box function). Nevertheless, keep in mind that this is the kind of maths you will need to master anyway sooner than later – this is inevitable. Perhaps you should go back to, e.g., the appendix on Matrix Computations with R or the chapter on Linear Regression? Learning maths is not a linear, step-by-step process. Everyone is different and will have a different path to success. The material needs to be frequently revisited, it will “click” someday, don’t you worry; good stuff isn’t built in a day or seven. Recall that the output of the logistic regression model (1-layer neural network with softmax) can be written in the matrix form as: \\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}=\\mathrm{softmax}\\left( \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\,\\mathbf{B} \\right), \\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{X}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times 785}\\) is a matrix representing \\(n\\) images of size \\(28\\times 28\\), augmented with a column of \\(1\\)s, and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{785\\times 10}\\) is the coefficients matrix and \\(\\mathrm{softmax}\\) is applied on each matrix row separately. Of course, by the definition of matrix multiplication, \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\) will be a matrix of size \\(n\\times 10\\), where \\(\\hat{y}_{i,k}\\) represents the predicted probability that the \\(i\\)-th image depicts the \\(k\\)-th digit. # convert to matrices of size n*784 # and add a column of 1s X_train1 &lt;- cbind(1.0, matrix(X_train, ncol=28*28)) X_test1 &lt;- cbind(1.0, matrix(X_test, ncol=28*28)) The nn_predict() function implements the above formula for \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\): softmax &lt;- function(T) { T &lt;- exp(T) T/rowSums(T) } nn_predict &lt;- function(B, X) { softmax(X %*% B) } Let’s define the functions to compute the cross-entropy (which we shall minimise) and accuracy (which we shall report to a user): cross_entropy &lt;- function(Y_true, Y_pred) { -sum(Y_true*log(Y_pred))/nrow(Y_true) } accuracy &lt;- function(Y_true, Y_pred) { # both arguments are one-hot encoded Y_true_decoded &lt;- apply(Y_true, 1, which.max) Y_pred_decoded &lt;- apply(Y_pred, 1, which.max) # proportion of equal corresponding pairs: mean(Y_true_decoded == Y_pred_decoded) } It may be shown (**) that the gradient of cross-entropy (with respect to the parameter matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) can be expressed in the matrix form as: \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{\\dot{X}}^T\\, (\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}-\\mathbf{Y}) \\] grad_cross_entropy &lt;- function(X, Y_true, Y_pred) { t(X) %*% (Y_pred-Y_true)/nrow(Y_true) } Of course, we could always substitute the gradient with the finite difference approximation. Yet, this would be much slower). The more mathematically inclined reader will sure notice that by expanding the formulas given in the previous chapter, we can write cross-entropy in the non-matrix form (\\(n\\) – number of samples, \\(K\\) – number of classes, \\(p+1\\) – number of model parameters; in our case \\(K=10\\) and \\(p=784\\)) as: \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} E(\\mathbf{B}) &amp;=&amp; -\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K y_{i,k} \\log\\left( \\frac{ \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,k} \\right) }{ \\displaystyle\\sum_{c=1}^K \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,c} \\right) } \\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\log \\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,k} \\right)\\right) - \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K y_{i,k} \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,k} \\right). \\end{array} \\] Partial derivatives of cross-entropy w.r.t. \\(\\beta_{a,b}\\) in non-matrix form can be derived (**) so as to get: \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} \\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\beta_{a,b}}(\\mathbf{B}) &amp;=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{x}_{i,a} \\left( \\frac{ \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,b} \\right) }{ \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^K \\exp\\left( \\displaystyle\\sum_{j=0}^p \\dot{x}_{i,j} \\beta_{j,k} \\right) } - y_{i,b} \\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{x}_{i,a} \\left( \\hat{y}_{i,b} - y_{i,b} \\right). \\end{array} \\] Safe landing zone. In case you’re lost with the above, continue from here. However, in the near future, harden up and revisit the skipped material to get the most out of our discussion. We now have all the building blocks to implement the gradient descent method. The algorithm below follows exactly the same scheme as the one in the \\(g\\) function example. This time, however, we play with a parameter matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (not a parameter vector \\([x_1, x_2]\\)) and we compute the gradient of cross-entropy (by means of grad_cross_entropy()), not the gradient of \\(g\\). Note that a call to system.time(expr) measures the time (in seconds) spent evaluating an expression expr. # random matrix of size 785x10 - initial guess B &lt;- matrix(rnorm(ncol(X_train1)*ncol(Y_train2)), nrow=ncol(X_train1)) eta &lt;- 0.1 # learning rate maxit &lt;- 100 # number of GD iterations system.time({ # measure time spent # for simplicity, we stop only when we reach maxit for (i in 1:maxit) { B &lt;- B - eta*grad_cross_entropy( X_train1, Y_train2, nn_predict(B, X_train1)) } }) # `user` - processing time in seconds: ## user system elapsed ## 93.505 41.989 34.407 Unfortunately, the method’s convergence is really slow (we are optimising over \\(7850\\) parameters…) and the results after 100 iterations are disappointing: accuracy(Y_train2, nn_predict(B, X_train1)) ## [1] 0.46462 accuracy(Y_test2, nn_predict(B, X_test1)) ## [1] 0.4735 Recall that in the previous chapter we obtained much better classification accuracy by using the keras package. What are we doing wrong then? Maybe keras implements some Super-Fancy Hyper Optimisation Framework (TM) (R) that we could get access to for only $19.99 per month? 6.3.5 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (*) In turns out that there’s a very simple cure for the slow convergence of our method. It might be shocking for some, but sometimes the true global minimum of cross-entropy for the whole training set is not exactly what we really want. In our predictive modelling task, we are minimising train error, but what we actually desire is to minimise the test error (which we cannot refer to while training = no cheating!). It is therefore rational to assume that both the train and the test set consist of random digits independently sampled from the set of “all the possible digits out there in the world”. Looking at the original objective (cross-entropy): \\[ E(\\mathbf{B}) = -\\frac{1}{n^\\text{train}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n^\\text{train}} \\log \\Pr(Y=y_i^\\text{train}|\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}^\\text{train},\\mathbf{B}). \\] How about we try fitting to different random samples of the train set in each iteration of the gradient descent method instead of fitting to the whole train set? \\[ E(\\mathbf{B}) \\simeq -\\frac{1}{b} \\sum_{i=1}^b \\log \\Pr(Y=y_{\\text{random\\_index}_i}^\\text{train}|\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{random\\_index}_i,\\cdot}^\\text{train},\\mathbf{B}), \\] where \\(b\\) is some fixed batch size. Such an approach is often called stochastic gradient descent. Remark. This scheme is sometimes referred to as mini-batch gradient descent in the literature; some researchers reserve the term “stochastic” only for batches of size 1. Stochastic gradient descent can be implemented very easily: B &lt;- matrix(rnorm(ncol(X_train1)*ncol(Y_train2)), nrow=ncol(X_train1)) eta &lt;- 0.1 maxit &lt;- 100 batch_size &lt;- 32 system.time({ for (i in 1:maxit) { wh &lt;- sample(nrow(X_train1), size=batch_size) B &lt;- B - eta*grad_cross_entropy( X_train1[wh,], Y_train2[wh,], nn_predict(B, X_train1[wh,]) ) } }) ## user system elapsed ## 0.088 0.008 0.096 accuracy(Y_train2, nn_predict(B, X_train1)) ## [1] 0.46198 accuracy(Y_test2, nn_predict(B, X_test1)) ## [1] 0.4693 The errors are much worse but at least we got the (useless) solution very quickly. That’s the “fail fast” rule in practice. However, why don’t we increase the number of iterations and see what happens? We’ve allowed the classic gradient descent to scrabble around the MNIST dataset for almost 2 minutes. B &lt;- matrix(rnorm(ncol(X_train1)*ncol(Y_train2)), nrow=ncol(X_train1)) eta &lt;- 0.1 maxit &lt;- 10000 batch_size &lt;- 32 system.time({ for (i in 1:maxit) { wh &lt;- sample(nrow(X_train1), size=batch_size) B &lt;- B - eta*grad_cross_entropy( X_train1[wh,], Y_train2[wh,], nn_predict(B, X_train1[wh,]) ) } }) ## user system elapsed ## 7.551 0.239 7.789 accuracy(Y_train2, nn_predict(B, X_train1)) ## [1] 0.89222 accuracy(Y_test2, nn_predict(B, X_test1)) ## [1] 0.8935 Bingo! Let’s take a closer look at how the train/test error behaves in each iteration for different batch sizes. Figures 6.14 and 6.15 depict the cases of batch_size of 32 and 128, respectively. The time needed to go through 10000 iterations with batch size of 32 is: ## user system elapsed ## 83.320 27.062 34.415 Figure 6.14: Cross-entropy and accuracy on the train and test set in each iteration of SGD; batch size of 32 What’s more, batch size of 128 takes: ## user system elapsed ## 193.550 97.463 57.588 Figure 6.15: Cross-entropy and accuracy on the train and test set in each iteration of SGD; batch size of 128 Exercise. Draw conclusions. 6.4 A Note on Convex Optimisation (*) Are there any cases where we are sure that a local minimum is the global minimum? It turns out that the answer to this is positive; for example, when we minimise objective functions that fulfil a special property defined below. First let’s note that given two points \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\), by taking any \\(\\theta\\in[0,1]\\), the point defined as: \\[ \\mathbf{t} = \\theta \\mathbf{x}_{1}+(1-\\theta)\\mathbf{x}_{2} \\] lies on a (straight) line segment between \\(\\mathbf{x}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\). Definition. We say that a function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^p\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) is convex, whenever: \\[ (\\forall \\mathbf{x}_{1},\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\in \\mathbb{R}^p) (\\forall \\theta\\in [0,1])\\quad f(\\theta \\mathbf{x}_{1}+(1-\\theta)\\mathbf{x}_{2})\\leq \\theta f(\\mathbf{x}_{1})+(1-\\theta)f(\\mathbf{x}_{2}) \\] In other words, the function’s value at any convex combination of two points is not greater than that combination of the function values at these two points. See Figure 6.16 for a graphical illustration of the above. Figure 6.16: An illustration of the definition of a convex function The following result addresses the question we posed at the beginning of this section. Theorem. For any convex function \\(f\\), if \\(f\\) has a local minimum at \\(\\mathbf{x}^+\\) then \\(\\mathbf{x}^+\\) is also its global minimum. Convex functions are ubiquitous in machine learning, but of course not every objective function we are going to deal with will fulfil this property. Here are some basic examples of convex functions and how they come into being, see, e.g., (Boyd &amp; Vandenberghe 2004) for more: the functions mapping \\(x\\) to \\(x, x^2, |x|, e^x\\) are all convex, \\(f(x)=|x|^p\\) is convex for all \\(p\\ge 1\\), if \\(f\\) is convex, then \\(-f\\) is concave, if \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) are convex, then \\(w_1 f_1 + w_2 f_2\\) are convex for any \\(w_1,w_2\\ge 0\\), if \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) are convex, then \\(\\max\\{f_1, f_2\\}\\) is convex, if \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are convex and \\(g\\) is non-decreasing, then \\(g(f(x))\\) is convex. The above feature the building blocks of our error measures in supervised learning problems! In particular, sum of squared residuals in linear regression is a convex function of the underlying parameters. Also, cross-entropy in logistic regression is a convex function of the underlying parameters. Theorem. (***) If a function is twice differentiable, then its convexity can be judged based on the positive-definiteness of its Hessian matrix. Note that optimising convex functions is relatively easy, especially if they are differentiable. This is because they are quite well-behaving. However, it doesn’t mean that we an analytic solution to the problem of their minimisation. Methods such as gradient descent or BFGS should work well (unless there are vast regions where a function is constant or the function’s is defined over a large number of parameters). Remark. (**) There is a special class of constrained optimisation problems called linear and, more generally, quadratic programming that involves convex functions. Moreover, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions address the more general problem of minimisation with constraints (i.e., not over the whole \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\) set); see (Nocedal &amp; Wright 2006, Fletcher 2008) for more details. Remark. Not only functions, but also sets can be said to be convex. We say that \\(C\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^p\\) is a convex set, whenever the line segment joining any two points in \\(C\\) is fully included in \\(C\\). More formally, for every \\(\\mathbf{x}_1\\in C\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\in C\\), it holds \\(\\theta \\mathbf{x}_{1}+(1-\\theta)\\mathbf{x}_{2} \\in C\\) for all \\(\\theta\\in [0,1]\\); see Figure 6.17 for an illustration. Figure 6.17: A convex and a non-convex set 6.5 Outro 6.5.1 Remarks Solving continuous problems with many variables (e.g., deep neural networks) is time consuming – the more variables to optimise over (e.g., model parameters, think the number of interconnections between all the neurons), the slower the optimisation process. Moreover, it might be the case that the sole objective function takes long to compute (think of image classification with large training samples). Remark. (*) Although theoretically possible, good luck fitting a logistic regression model to MNIST with optim()’s BFGS – there are 7850 variables! Training deep neural networks with SGD is even slower (more parameters), but there is a trick to propagate weight updates layer by layer, called backpropagation (actually used in every neural network library), see, e.g., (Sarle &amp; others 2002) and (Goodfellow et al. 2016). Moreover, keras and similar libraries implement automatic differentiation procedures that make its user’s life much easier (swiping some of the tedious math under the comfy carpet). keras implements various optimisers that we can refer to in the compile() function, see https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/compile.html and https://keras.io/optimizers/: SGD – stochastic gradient descent supporting momentum and learning rate decay, RMSprop – divides the gradient by a running average of its recent magnitude, Adam – adaptive momentum, and so on. These are all non-complicated variations of the pure stochastic GD. Some of them are just tricks that work well in some examples and destroy the convergence on many other ones. You can get into their details in a dedicated book/course aimed at covering neural networks (see, e.g., (Sarle &amp; others 2002), (Goodfellow et al. 2016)), but we have already developed some good intuitions here. Keep in mind that with methods such as GD or SGD, there is no guarantee we reach a minimum, but an approximate solution is better than no solution at all. Also sometimes (especially in ML applications) we don’t really need the actual minimum (e.g., when optimising the error with respect to the train set). Those “mathematically pure” will find that a bit… unaesthetic, but here we are. Maybe the solution makes your boss or client happy, maybe it generates revenue. Maybe it helps solve some other problem. Some claim that a solution is better than no solution at all, remember? But… is it really always the case though? 6.5.2 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (Nocedal &amp; Wright 2006), (Boyd &amp; Vandenberghe 2004), (Fletcher 2008). References "],

There will be not much work on-going in this repository anymore, as its sources have moved elsewhere; however, if you happen to find any bugs or typos, please drop me an email. I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. 7.1 Unsupervised Learning 7.1.1 Introduction In unsupervised learning (learning without a teacher), the input data points \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1,\\cdot},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{n,\\cdot}\\) are not assigned any reference labels (compare Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1: Unsupervised learning: “But what it is exactly that I have to do here?” Our aim now is to discover the underlying structure in the data, whatever that means. 7.1.2 Main Types of Unsupervised Learning Problems It turns out, however, that certain classes of unsupervised learning problems are not only intellectually stimulating, but practically useful at the same time. In particular, in dimensionality reduction we seek a meaningful projection of a high dimensional space (think: many variables/columns). Figure 7.2: Principal component analysis (a dimensionality reduction technique) applied on three features of red wines For instance, Figure 7.2 reveals that the “alcohol”, “response” and “residual.sugar” dimensions of the Wine Quality dataset that we have studied earlier on can actually be nicely depicted (with no much loss of information) on a two-dimensional plot. It turns out that the wine experts’ opinion on a wine’s quality is highly correlated with the amount of… alcohol in a bottle. On the other hand, sugar is orthogonal (unrelated) to these two. Amongst example dimensionality reduction methods we find: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) Principal component analysis (PCA) Kernel PCA t-SNE Autoencoders (deep learning) See, for example, (Hastie et al. 2017) for more details. Furthermore, in anomaly detection, our task is to identify rare, suspicious, ab-normal or out-standing items. For example, these can be cars on walkways in a park’s security camera footage. (#fig:anomaly_detection) Outliers can be thought of anomalies of some sort Finally, the aim of clustering is to automatically discover some naturally occurring subgroups in the data set, compare Figure 7.3. For example, these may be customers having different shopping patterns (such as “young parents”, “students”, “boomers”). Figure 7.3: NEWS FLASH! SCIENTISTS SHOWED (by writing about it) THAT SOME VERY IMPORTANT THING (Iris dataset) COMES IN THREE DIFFERENT FLAVOURS (by applying the 3-means clustering algorithm)! 7.1.3 Definitions Formally, given \\(K\\ge 2\\), clustering aims is to find a special kind of a \\(K\\)-partition of the input data set \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). Definition. We say that \\(\\mathcal{C}=\\{C_1,\\dots,C_K\\}\\) is a \\(K\\)-partition of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) of size \\(n\\), whenever: \\(C_k\\neq\\emptyset\\) for all \\(k\\) (each set is nonempty), \\(C_k\\cap C_l=\\emptyset\\) for all \\(k\\neq l\\) (sets are pairwise disjoint), \\(\\bigcup_{k=1}^K C_k=\\mathbf{X}\\) (no point is neglected). This can also be thought of as assigning each point a unique label \\(\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\) (think: colouring of the points, where each number has a colour). We will consider the point \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) as labelled \\(j\\) if and only if it belongs to cluster \\(C_j\\), i.e., \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\in C_j\\). Example applications of clustering: taxonomisation: e.g., partition the consumers to more “uniform” groups to better understand who they are and what do they need, image processing: e.g., object detection, like tumour tissues on medical images, complex networks analysis: e.g., detecting communities in friendship, retweets and other networks, fine-tuning supervised learning algorithms: e.g., recommender systems indicating content that was rated highly by users from the same group or learning multiple manifolds in a dimension reduction task. The number of possible \\(K\\)-partitions of a set with \\(n\\) elements is given by the Stirling number of the second kind: \\[ \\left\\{{n \\atop K}\\right\\}={\\frac {1}{K!}}\\sum _{{j=0}}^{{K}}(-1)^{{K-j}}{\\binom {K}{j}}j^{n}; \\] e.g., already \\(\\left\\{{n \\atop 2}\\right\\}=2^{n-1}-1\\) and \\(\\left\\{{n \\atop 3}\\right\\}=O(3^n)\\) – that is a lot. Certainly, we are not just interested in “any” partition – some of them will be more meaningful or valuable than others. However, even one of the most famous ML textbooks provides us with only a vague hint of what we might be looking for: “Definition”. Clustering concerns “segmenting a collection of objects into subsets so that those within each cluster are more closely related to one another than objects assigned to different clusters” (Hastie et al. 2017). It is not uncommon to equate the general definition of data clustering problems with… the particular outputs yield by specific clustering algorithms. It some sense, that sounds fair. From this perspective, we might be interested in identifying the two main types of clustering algorithms: parametric (model-based): find clusters of specific shapes or following specific multidimensional probability distributions, e.g., \\(K\\)-means, expectation-maximisation for Gaussian mixtures (EM), average linkage agglomerative clustering; nonparametric (model-free): identify high-density or well-separable regions, perhaps in the presence of noise points, e.g., single linkage agglomerative clustering, Genie, (H)DBSCAN, BIRCH. In this chapter we’ll take a look at two classical approaches to clustering: K-means clustering that looks for a specific number of clusters, (agglomerative) hierarchical clustering that outputs a whole hierarchy of nested data partitions. 7.2 K-means Clustering 7.2.1 Example in R Let’s begin our clustering adventure by applying the \\(K\\)-means clustering method to find \\(K=3\\) groups in the famous Fisher’s iris data set (variables Sepal.Width and Petal.Length variables only): X &lt;- as.matrix(iris[,c(3,2)]) # never forget to set nstart&gt;&gt;1! km &lt;- kmeans(X, centers=3, nstart=10) km$cluster # labels assigned to each of 150 points: ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [35] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## [69] 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 51 entries ] Remark. Later we’ll see that nstart is responsible for random restarting the (local) optimisation procedure, just as we did in the previous chapter. Let’s draw a scatter plot that depicts the detected clusters: plot(X, col=km$cluster) Figure 7.4: 3-means clustering on a projection of the Iris dataset The colours in Figure 7.4 indicate the detected clusters. The left group is clearly well-separated from the other two. What can we do with this information? Well, if we were experts on plants (in the 1930s), that’d definitely be something ground-breaking. Figure 7.5 is a version of the aforementioned scatter plot now with the true iris species added. plot(X, col=km$cluster, pch=as.numeric(iris$Species)) Figure 7.5: 3-means clustering (colours) vs true Iris species (shapes) Here is a contingency table for detected clusters vs. true iris species: (C &lt;- table(km$cluster, iris$Species)) ## ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 1 50 0 0 ## 2 0 2 41 ## 3 0 48 9 It turns out that the discovered partition matches the original iris species very well. We have just made a “discovery” in the field of botany (actually some research fields classify their objects of study into families, genres etc. by means of such tools). Were the actual Iris species what we had hoped to match? Was that our aim? Well, surely we have had begun our journey with “clear minds” (yet with hungry eyes). Note that the true class labels were not used during the clustering procedure – we’re dealing with an unsupervised learning problem here. The result turned useful, it’s a win. Remark. (*) There are several indices that assess the similarity of two partitions, for example the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) the Normalised Mutual Information Score (NMI) or set matching-based measures, see, e.g., (Hubert &amp; Arabie 1985), (Rezaei &amp; Fränti 2016). 7.2.2 Problem Statement The aim of \\(K\\)-means clustering is to find \\(K\\) “good” cluster centres \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot}\\). Then, a point \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) will be assigned to the cluster represented by the closest centre. Here, by closest we mean the squared Euclidean distance. More formally, assuming all the points are in a \\(p\\)-dimensional space, \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\), we define the distance between the \\(i\\)-th point and the \\(k\\)-th centre as: \\[ d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}) = \\| \\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot} - \\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot} \\|^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left(x_{i,j}-\\mu_{k,j}\\right)^2 \\] Then the \\(i\\)-th point’s cluster is determined by: \\[ \\mathrm{C}(i) = \\mathrm{arg}\\min_{k=1,\\dots,K} d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}), \\] where, as usual, \\(\\mathrm{arg}\\min\\) (argument minimum) is the index \\(k\\) that minimises the given expression. In the previous example, the three identified cluster centres in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) are given by (see Figure 7.6 for illustration): km$centers ## Petal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1 1.4620 3.4280 ## 2 5.6721 3.0326 ## 3 4.3281 2.7509 plot(X, col=km$cluster, asp=1) # asp=1 gives the same scale on both axes points(km$centers, cex=2, col=4, pch=16) Figure 7.6: Cluster centres (blue dots) identified by the 3-means algorithm Figure 7.7 depicts the partition of the whole \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) space into clusters based on the closeness to the three cluster centres. Figure 7.7: The division of the whole space into three sets based on the proximity to cluster centres (a so-called Voronoi diagram) To compute the distances between all the points and the cluster centres, we may call pdist::pdist(): library(&quot;pdist&quot;) D &lt;- as.matrix(pdist(X, km$centers))^2 head(D) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0.009028 18.469 9.1348 ## [2,] 0.187028 18.252 8.6357 ## [3,] 0.078228 19.143 9.3709 ## [4,] 0.109028 17.411 8.1199 ## [5,] 0.033428 18.573 9.2946 ## [6,] 0.279428 16.530 8.2272 where D[i,k] gives the squared Euclidean distance between \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}\\). The cluster memberships the (\\(\\mathrm{arg}\\min\\)s) can now be determined by: (idx &lt;- apply(D, 1, which.min)) # for every row of D... ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [35] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## [69] 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 51 entries ] all(km$cluster == idx) # sanity check ## [1] TRUE 7.2.3 Algorithms for the K-means Problem All good, but how do we find “good” cluster centres? Good, better, best… yet again we are in a need for a goodness-of-fit metric. In the \\(K\\)-means clustering, we determine \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot}\\) that minimise the total within-cluster distances (distances from each point to each own cluster centre): \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\sum_{i=1}^n d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{C(i),\\cdot}), \\] Note that the \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu\\)s are also “hidden” inside the point-to-cluster belongingness mapping, \\(\\mathrm{C}\\). Expanding the above yields: \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\min_{k=1,\\dots,K} \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left(x_{i,j}-\\mu_{k,j}\\right)^2 \\right). \\] Unfortunately, the \\(\\min\\) operator in the objective function makes this optimisation problem not tractable with the methods discussed in the previous chapter. The above problem is hard to solve (* more precisely, it is an NP-hard problem). Therefore, in practice we use various heuristics to solve it. The kmeans() function itself implements 3 of them: the Hartigan-Wong, Lloyd (a.k.a. Lloyd-Forgy) and MacQueen algorithms. Remark. (*) Technically, there is no such thing as “the K-means algorithm” – all the aforementioned methods are particular heuristic approaches to solving the K-means clustering problem formalised as the above optimisation task. By setting nstart = 10 above, we ask the (Hartigan-Wong, which is the default one in kmeans()) algorithm to find 10 solution candidates obtained by considering different random initial clusterings and choose the best one (with respect to the sum of within-cluster distances) amongst them. This does not guarantee finding the optimal solution, especially for very unbalanced datasets, but increases the likelihood of such. Remark. The squared Euclidean distance was of course chosen to make computations easier. It turns out that for any given subset of input points \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i_1,\\cdot},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{i_m,\\cdot}\\), the point \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}\\) that minimises the total distances to all of them, i.e., \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}\\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^m \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left(x_{i_\\ell,j}-\\mu_{k,j}\\right)^2 \\right), \\] is exactly these points’ centroid – which is given by the componentwise arithmetic means of their coordinates. For example: colMeans(X[km$cluster == 1,]) # centroid of the points in the 1st cluster ## Petal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1.462 3.428 km$centers[1,] # the centre of the 1st cluster ## Petal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1.462 3.428 Among the various heuristics to solve the K-means problem, Lloyd’s algorithm (1957) is perhaps the simplest. This is probably the reason why it is sometimes referred to as “the” K-means algorithm: Start with random cluster centres \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot}\\). For each point \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\), determine its closest centre \\(C(i)\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\): \\[ \\mathrm{C}(i) = \\mathrm{arg}\\min_{k=1,\\dots,K} d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}). \\] For each cluster \\(k\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\), compute the new cluster centre \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}\\) as the centroid of all the point indices \\(i\\) such that \\(C(i)=k\\). If the cluster centres changed since the last iteration, go to step 2, otherwise stop and return the result. (*) Here’s an example implementation. As the initial cluster centres, let’s pick some “noisy” versions of \\(K\\) randomly chosen points in \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). set.seed(12345) K &lt;- 3 # Random initial cluster centres: M &lt;- jitter(X[sample(1:nrow(X), K),]) M ## Petal.Length Sepal.Width ## [1,] 5.1004 3.0814 ## [2,] 4.7091 3.1861 ## [3,] 3.3196 2.4094 In what follows, we will be maintaining a matrix such that D[i,k] is the distance between the \\(i\\)-th point and the \\(k\\)-th centre and a vector such that idx[i] denotes the index of the cluster centre closest to the i-th point. D &lt;- as.matrix(pdist(X, M))^2 idx &lt;- apply(D, 1, which.min) repeat { # Determine the new cluster centres: M &lt;- t(sapply(1:K, function(k) { # the centroid of all points in the k-th cluster: colMeans(X[idx==k,]) })) # Store the previous cluster belongingness info: old_idx &lt;- idx # Recompute D and idx: D &lt;- as.matrix(pdist(X, M))^2 idx &lt;- apply(D, 1, which.min) # Check if converged already: if (all(idx == old_idx)) break } Let’s compare the obtained cluster centres with the ones returned by kmeans(): M # our result ## Petal.Length Sepal.Width ## [1,] 5.6721 3.0326 ## [2,] 4.3281 2.7509 ## [3,] 1.4620 3.4280 km$center # result of kmeans() ## Petal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1 1.4620 3.4280 ## 2 5.6721 3.0326 ## 3 4.3281 2.7509 These two represent exactly the same 3-partitions (note that the actual labels (the order of centres) are not important). The value of the objective function (total within-cluster distances) at the identified candidate solution is equal to: sum(D[cbind(1:nrow(X),idx)]) # indexing with a 2-column matrix! ## [1] 40.737 km$tot.withinss # as reported by kmeans() ## [1] 40.737 We would need it if we were to implement the nstart functionality, which is left as an: Exercise. (*) Wrap the implementation of the Lloyd algorithm into a standalone R function, with a similar look-and-feel as the original kmeans(). Figure 7.8: The arrows denote the cluster centres in each iteration of the Lloyd algorithm On a side note, our algorithm needed 4 iterations to identify the (locally optimal) cluster centres. Figure 7.8 depicts its quest for the clustering grail. 7.3 Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering 7.3.1 Introduction In K-means, we need to specify the number of clusters, \\(K\\), in advance. What if we don’t have any idea how to choose this parameter (which is often the case)? Also, the problem with K-means is that there is no guarantee that a \\(K\\)-partition is any “similar” to the \\(K&#39;\\)-one for \\(K\\neq K&#39;\\), see Figure 7.9. km1 &lt;- kmeans(X, 3, nstart=10) km2 &lt;- kmeans(X, 4, nstart=10) plot(X, col=km1$cluster, pch=km2$cluster, asp=1) Figure 7.9: 3-means (colours) vs. 4-means (symbols) on example data; the “circle” cluster cannot decide if it likes the green or the black one more Hierarchical methods, on the other hand, output a whole hierarchy of mutually nested partitions, which increase the interpretability of the results. A \\(K\\)-partition for any \\(K\\) can be extracted later at any time. In this book we will be interested in agglomerative hierarchical algorithms: at the lowest level of the hierarchy, each point belongs to its own cluster (there are \\(n\\) singletons); at the highest level of the hierarchy, there is one cluster that embraces all the points; moving from the \\(i\\)-th to the \\((i+1)\\)-th level, we select (somehow; see below) a pair of clusters to be merged. 7.3.2 Example in R The most basic implementation of a few agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms is provided by the hclust() function, which works on a pairwise distance matrix. # Euclidean distances between all pairs of points: D &lt;- dist(X) # Apply Complete Linkage (the default, details below): h &lt;- hclust(D) # method=&quot;complete&quot; print(h) ## ## Call: ## hclust(d = D) ## ## Cluster method : complete ## Distance : euclidean ## Number of objects: 150 Remark. There are \\(n(n-1)/2\\) unique pairwise distances between \\(n\\) points. Don’t try calling dist() on large data matrices. Already \\(n=100{,}000\\) points consumes 40 GB of available memory (assuming that each distance is stored as an 8-byte double-precision floating point number); packages fastcluster and genieclust, among other, aim to solve this problem. The obtained hierarchy (tree) can be cut at an arbitrary level by applying the cutree() function. cutree(h, k=3) # extract the 3-partition ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [35] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ## [69] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 51 entries ] The cuts of the hierarchy at different levels are depicted in Figure 7.10. The obtained 3-partition also matches the true Iris species quite well. However, now it makes total sense to “zoom” our partitioning in or out and investigate how are the subgroups decomposed or aggregated when we change \\(K\\). par(mfrow=c(2,2)) plot(X, col=cutree(h, k=5), ann=FALSE) legend(&quot;top&quot;, legend=&quot;k=5&quot;, bg=&quot;white&quot;) plot(X, col=cutree(h, k=4), ann=FALSE) legend(&quot;top&quot;, legend=&quot;k=4&quot;, bg=&quot;white&quot;) plot(X, col=cutree(h, k=3), ann=FALSE) legend(&quot;top&quot;, legend=&quot;k=3&quot;, bg=&quot;white&quot;) plot(X, col=cutree(h, k=2), ann=FALSE) legend(&quot;top&quot;, legend=&quot;k=2&quot;, bg=&quot;white&quot;) Figure 7.10: Complete linkage – 4 different cuts 7.3.3 Linkage Functions Let’s formalise the clustering process. Initially, \\(\\mathcal{C}^{(0)}=\\{\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1,\\cdot}\\},\\dots,\\{\\mathbf{x}_{n,\\cdot}\\}\\}\\), i.e., each point is a member of its own cluster. While an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is being computed, there are \\(n-k\\) clusters at the \\(k\\)-th step of the procedure, \\(\\mathcal{C}^{(k)}=\\{C_1^{(k)},\\dots,C_{n-k}^{(k)}\\}\\). When proceeding from step \\(k\\) to \\(k+1\\), we determine the two groups \\(C_u^{(k)}\\) and \\(C_v^{(k)}\\), \\(u&lt;v\\), to be merged together so that the clustering at the higher level is of the form: \\[ \\mathcal{C}^{(k+1)} = \\left\\{ C_1^{(k)},\\dots,C_{u-1}^{(k)}, C_u^{(k)}{\\cup C_v^{(k)}}, C_{u+1}^{(k)},\\dots,C_{v-1}^{(k)}, C_{v+1}^{(k)},\\dots,C_{n-k}^{(k)} \\right\\}. \\] Thus, \\((\\mathcal{C}^{(0)}, \\mathcal{C}^{(1)}, \\dots, \\mathcal{C}^{(n-1)})\\) form a sequence of nested partitions of the input dataset with the last level being just one big cluster, \\(\\mathcal{C}^{(n-1)}=\\left\\{ \\{\\mathbf{x}_{1,\\cdot},\\mathbf{x}_{2,\\cdot},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{n,\\cdot}\\} \\right\\}\\). There is one component missing – how to determine the pair of clusters \\(C_u^{(k)}\\) and \\(C_v^{(k)}\\) to be merged with each other at the \\(k\\)-th iteration? Of course this will be expressed as some optimisation problem (although this time, a simple one)! The decision will be based on: \\[ \\mathrm{arg}\\min_{u &lt; v} d^*(C_u^{(k)}, C_v^{(k)}), \\] where \\(d^*(C_u^{(k)}, C_v^{(k)})\\) is the distance between two clusters \\(C_u^{(k)}\\) and \\(C_v^{(k)}\\). Note that we usually only consider the distances between individual points, not sets of points. Hence, \\(d^*\\) must be a suitable extension of a pointwise distance \\(d\\) (usually the Euclidean metric) to whole sets. We will assume that \\(d^*(\\{\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\},\\{\\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot}\\})= d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot})\\), i.e., the distance between singleton clusters is the same as the distance between the points themselves. As far as more populous point groups are concerned, there are many popular choices of \\(d^*\\) (which in the context of hierarchical clustering we call linkage functions): single linkage: \\[ d_\\text{S}^*(C_u^{(k)}, C_v^{(k)}) = \\min_{\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\in C_u^{(k)}, \\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot}\\in C_v^{(k)}} d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot}), \\] complete linkage: \\[ d_\\text{C}^*(C_u^{(k)}, C_v^{(k)}) = \\max_{\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\in C_u^{(k)}, \\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot}\\in C_v^{(k)}} d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot}), \\] average linkage: \\[ d_\\text{A}^*(C_u^{(k)}, C_v^{(k)}) = \\frac{1}{|C_u^{(k)}| |C_v^{(k)}|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\in C_u^{(k)}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot}\\in C_v^{(k)}} d(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{x}_{j,\\cdot}). \\] An illustration of the way different linkages are computed is given in Figure 7.11. Figure 7.11: In single linkage, we find the closest pair of points; in complete linkage, we seek the pair furthest away from each other; in average linkage, we determine the arithmetic mean of all pairwise distances Assuming \\(d_\\text{S}^*\\), \\(d_\\text{C}^*\\) or \\(d_\\text{A}^*\\) in the aforementioned procedure leads to single, complete or average linkage-based agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms, respectively (referred to as single linkage etc. for brevity). hs &lt;- hclust(D, method=&quot;single&quot;) hc &lt;- hclust(D, method=&quot;complete&quot;) ha &lt;- hclust(D, method=&quot;average&quot;) Figure 7.12 compares the 5-, 4- and 3-partitions obtained by applying the 3 above linkages. Note that it’s in very nature of the single linkage algorithm that it’s highly sensitive to outliers. Figure 7.12: 3 cuts of 3 different hierarchies 7.3.4 Cluster Dendrograms A dendrogram (which we can plot by calling plot(h), where h is the result returned by hclust()) depicts the distances (as defined by the linkage function) between the clusters merged at every stage of the agglomerative procedure. This can provide us with some insight into the underlying data structure as well as with hits about at which level the tree could be cut. Figure 7.13 depicts the three dendrograms that correspond to the clusterings obtained by applying different linkages. Each tree has 150 leaves (at the bottom) that represent the 150 points in our example dataset. Each “edge” (joint) represents a group of points being merged. For instance, the very top joint in the middle subfigure is located at height of \\(\\simeq 6\\), which is exactly the maximal pairwise distance (complete linkage) between the points in the last two last clusters. Figure 7.13: Cluster dendrograms for the single, complete and average linkages 7.4 Exercises in R 7.4.1 Clustering of the World Factbook Let’s perform a cluster analysis of countries based on the information contained in the World Factbook dataset: factbook &lt;- read.csv(&quot;datasets/world_factbook_2020.csv&quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) Exercise. Remove all the columns that consist of more than 40 missing values. Then remove all the rows with at least 1 missing value. Click here for a solution. To remove appropriate columns, we must first count the number of NAs in them. count_na_in_columns &lt;- sapply(factbook, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) factbook &lt;- factbook[count_na_in_columns &lt;= 40] # column removal Getting rid of the rows plagued by missing values is as simple as calling the na.omit() function: factbook &lt;- na.omit(factbook) # row removal dim(factbook) # how many rows and cols remained ## [1] 203 23 Missing value removal is necessary for metric-based clustering methods, especially K-means. Otherwise, some of the computed distances would be not available. Exercise. Standardise all the numeric columns. Click here for a solution. Distance-based methods are very sensitive to the order of magnitude of the variables, and our dataset is a mess with regards to this (population, GDP, birth rate, oil production etc.) – standardisation of variables is definitely a good idea: for (i in 2:ncol(factbook)) # skip `country` factbook[[i]] &lt;- (factbook[[i]]-mean(factbook[[i]]))/ sd(factbook[[i]]) Recall that Z-scores (values of the standardised variables) have a very intuitive interpretation: \\(0\\) is the value equal to the column mean, \\(1\\) is one standard deviation above the mean, \\(-2\\) is two standard deviations below the mean etc. Exercise. Apply the 2-means algorithm, i.e., K-means with \\(K=2\\). Analyse the results. Click here for a solution. Calling kmeans(): km &lt;- kmeans(factbook[-1], 2, nstart=10) Let’s split the country list w.r.t. the obtained cluster labels.

Recall that the complete linkage-based method is implemented in the hclust() function: d &lt;- dist(factbook[-1]) # skip `country` h &lt;- hclust(d, method=&quot;complete&quot;) A “nice” number of clusters to divide our dataset into can be read from the dendrogram, see Figure 7.14. plot(h, labels=FALSE, ann=FALSE); box() Figure 7.14: Cluster dendrogram for the World Factbook dataset – Complete linkage It seems that a 9-partition might reveal something interesting, because it will distinguish two larger country groups. However, there will be many singletons if we do so either way. y &lt;- cutree(h, 9) h_countries &lt;- split(factbook[[1]], y) sapply(h_countries, length) # number of elements in each cluster ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 138 56 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 Most likely this is not an interesting partitioning of this dataset, therefore we’ll not be exploring it any further. Exercise. Apply the Genie clustering algorithm. Click here for a solution. The Genie algorithm (Gagolewski et al. 2016) is a hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in R package genieclust. It’s interface is compatible with hclust(). library(&quot;genieclust&quot;) d &lt;- dist(factbook[-1]) g &lt;- gclust(d) The cluster dendrogram in Figure 7.15 reveals 3 evident clusters. plot(g, labels=FALSE, ann=FALSE); box() Figure 7.15: Cluster dendrogram for the World Factbook dataset – Genie algorithm Let’s determine the 3-partition of the data set. y &lt;- cutree(g, 3) Here are few countries in each cluster: y &lt;- cutree(g, 3) sapply(split(factbook$countr, y), sample, 6) ## 1 2 ## [1,] &quot;Dominican Republic&quot; &quot;Congo, Republic of the&quot; ## [2,] &quot;Venezuela&quot; &quot;Sao Tome and Principe&quot; ## [3,] &quot;Sri Lanka&quot; &quot;Tanzania&quot; ## [4,] &quot;Malta&quot; &quot;Botswana&quot; ## [5,] &quot;China&quot; &quot;Congo, Democratic Republic of the&quot; ## [6,] &quot;Tajikistan&quot; &quot;Malawi&quot; ## 3 ## [1,] &quot;Lithuania&quot; ## [2,] &quot;Portugal&quot; ## [3,] &quot;Korea, South&quot; ## [4,] &quot;Bulgaria&quot; ## [5,] &quot;Germany&quot; ## [6,] &quot;Moldova&quot; We can draw the countries in each cluster on a map by using the rworldmap package (see its documentation for more details), see Figure 7.16. library(&quot;rworldmap&quot;) library(&quot;RColorBrewer&quot;) mapdata &lt;- data.frame(country=factbook$country, cluster=y) # 3 country names must be adjusted to get a match mapdata$country[mapdata$country == &quot;Czechia&quot;] &lt;- &quot;Czech Republic&quot; mapdata$country[mapdata$country == &quot;Eswatini&quot;] &lt;- &quot;Swaziland&quot; mapdata$country[mapdata$country == &quot;Cabo Verde&quot;] &lt;- &quot;Cape Verde&quot; mapdata &lt;- joinCountryData2Map(mapdata, joinCode=&quot;NAME&quot;, nameJoinColumn=&quot;country&quot;) ## 203 codes from your data successfully matched countries in the map ## 0 codes from your data failed to match with a country code in the map ## 40 codes from the map weren&#39;t represented in your data par(mar=c(0,0,0,0)) mapCountryData(mapdata, nameColumnToPlot=&quot;cluster&quot;, catMethod=&quot;categorical&quot;, missingCountryCol=&quot;gray&quot;, colourPalette=brewer.pal(3, &quot;Set1&quot;), mapTitle=&quot;&quot;, addLegend=TRUE) Figure 7.16: 3 clusters discovered by the Genie algorithm Here are the average Z-scores in each cluster: round(sapply(split(factbook[-1], y), colMeans), 3) ## 1 2 3 ## area 0.124 -0.068 -0.243 ## population 0.077 -0.058 -0.130 ## median_age 0.118 -1.219 1.261 ## population_growth_rate -0.227 1.052 -0.757 ## birth_rate -0.316 1.370 -0.930 ## death_rate -0.439 0.071 1.075 ## net_migration_rate -0.123 0.053 0.260 ## infant_mortality_rate -0.366 1.399 -0.835 ## life_expectancy_at_birth 0.354 -1.356 0.812 ## total_fertility_rate -0.363 1.332 -0.758 ## gdp_purchasing_power_parity 0.084 -0.213 0.052 ## gdp_real_growth_rate -0.062 0.126 0.002 ## gdp_per_capita_ppp 0.021 -0.744 0.905 ## labor_force 0.087 -0.096 -0.107 ## taxes_and_other_revenues -0.095 -0.584 1.006 ## budget_surplus_or_deficit -0.113 -0.188 0.543 ## inflation_rate_consumer_prices 0.044 -0.013 -0.099 ## exports -0.013 -0.318 0.447 ## imports 0.007 -0.308 0.379 ## telephones_fixed_lines 0.048 -0.244 0.186 ## internet_users 0.093 -0.178 -0.016 ## airports 0.104 -0.131 -0.107 That is really interesting! The interpretation of the above is left to the reader. 7.4.2 Unbalance Dataset – K-Means Needs Multiple Starts Let us consider a benchmark (artificial) dataset proposed in (Rezaei &amp; Fränti 2016): unbalance &lt;- as.matrix(read.csv(&quot;datasets/sipu_unbalance.csv&quot;, header=FALSE, sep=&quot; &quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;)) unbalance &lt;- unbalance/10000-30 # a more user-friendly scale According to its authors, this dataset is comprised of 8 clusters: there are 3 groups on the lefthand side (2000 points each) and 5 on the right side (100 each). plot(unbalance, asp=1) (#fig:sipu_unbalance2) sipu_unbalance dataset Exercise. Apply the K-means algorithm with \\(K=8\\). Click here for a solution. Of course, here by “the” K-means we mean the default method available in the kmeans() function. The clustering results are depicted in Figure 7.17. km &lt;- kmeans(unbalance, 8, nstart=10) plot(unbalance, asp=1, col=km$cluster) Figure 7.17: Results of K-means on the sipu_unbalance dataset This is far from what we expected. The total within-cluster distances are equal to: km$tot.withinss ## [1] 21713 Increasing the number of restarts even further improves the solution, but the local minimum is still far from the global one, compare Figure 7.18. km &lt;- suppressWarnings(kmeans(unbalance, 8, nstart=1000, iter.max=1000)) plot(unbalance, asp=1, col=km$cluster) Figure 7.18: Results of K-means on the sipu_unbalance dataset – many more restarts km$tot.withinss ## [1] 4378 Exercise. Apply the K-means algorithm starting from a “good” initial guess on the true cluster centres. Click here for a solution. Clustering is – in its essence – an unsupervised learning method, so what we’re going to do now could be called, let’s be blunt about it, cheating. Luckily, we have an oracle at our disposal – it has provided us with the following educated guesses (by looking at the scatter plot) about the localisation of the cluster centres: cntr &lt;- matrix(ncol=2, byrow=TRUE, c( -15, 5, -12, 10, -10, 5, 15, 0, 15, 10, 20, 5, 25, 0, 25, 10)) Running kmeans() yields the clustering depicted in Figure 7.19. km &lt;- kmeans(unbalance, cntr) plot(unbalance, asp=1, col=km$cluster) Figure 7.19: Results of K-means on the sipu_unbalance dataset – an educated guess on the cluster centres’ locations The total within-cluster distances are now equal to: km$tot.withinss ## [1] 2144.9 This is finally the globally optimal solution to the K-means problem we were asked to solve. Recall that the algorithms implemented in the kmeans() function are just fast heuristics that are supposed to find local optima of the K-means objective function, which is given by the within-cluster sum of squared Euclidean distances. 7.4.3 Clustering of Typical 2D Benchmark Datasets Let us consider a few clustering benchmark datasets available at https://github.com/gagolews/clustering_benchmarks_v1 and http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/. Here is a list of file names together with the corresponding numbers of clusters (as given by datasets’ authors): files &lt;- c(&quot;datasets/wut_isolation.csv&quot;, &quot;datasets/wut_mk2.csv&quot;, &quot;datasets/wut_z3.csv&quot;, &quot;datasets/sipu_aggregation.csv&quot;, &quot;datasets/sipu_pathbased.csv&quot;, &quot;datasets/sipu_unbalance.csv&quot;) Ks &lt;- c(3, 2, 4, 7, 3, 8) All the datasets are two-dimensional, hence we’ll be able to visualise the obtained results and assess the sensibility of the obtained clusterings. Exercise. Apply the K-means, the single, average and complete linkage and the Genie algorithm on the aforementioned datasets and discuss the results. Click here for a solution. Apart from a call to the Genie algorithm with the default parameters, we will also look at the results it generates when we set giniThreshold of 0.5. The following function is our workhorse that will perform all the computations and will draw all the figures for a single dataset: clusterise &lt;- function(file, K) { X &lt;- read.csv(file, header=FALSE, sep=&quot; &quot;, comment.char=&quot;#&quot;) d &lt;- dist(X) par(mfrow=c(2, 3)) par(mar=c(0.5, 0.5, 2, 0.5)) y &lt;- kmeans(X, K, nstart=10)$cluster plot(X, asp=1, col=y, ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE) mtext(&quot;K-means&quot;, line=0.5) y &lt;- cutree(hclust(d, &quot;complete&quot;), K) plot(X, asp=1, col=y, ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE) mtext(&quot;Complete Linkage&quot;, line=0.5) y &lt;- cutree(hclust(d, &quot;average&quot;), K) plot(X, asp=1, col=y, ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE) mtext(&quot;Average Linkage&quot;, line=0.5) y &lt;- cutree(hclust(d, &quot;single&quot;), K) plot(X, asp=1, col=y, ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE) mtext(&quot;Single Linkage&quot;, line=0.5) y &lt;- cutree(genieclust::gclust(d), K) # gini_threshold=0.3 plot(X, asp=1, col=y, ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE) mtext(&quot;Genie (default)&quot;, line=0.5) y &lt;- cutree(genieclust::gclust(d, gini_threshold=0.5), K) plot(X, asp=1, col=y, ann=FALSE, axes=FALSE) mtext(&quot;Genie (g=0.5)&quot;, line=0.5) } Applying the above as clusterise(files[i], Ks[i]) yields Figures 7.20-7.25. Figure 7.20: Clustering of the wut_isolation dataset Figure 7.21: Clustering of the wut_mk2 dataset Figure 7.22: Clustering of the wut_z3 dataset Figure 7.23: Clustering of the sipu_aggregation dataset Figure 7.24: Clustering of the sipu_pathbased dataset Figure 7.25: Clustering of the sipu_unbalance dataset Note that, by definition, K-means is only able to detect clusters of convex shapes. The Genie algorithm, on the other hand, might fail to detect clusters of very small sizes amongst the more populous ones. Single linkage is very sensitive to outliers in data – it often outputs clusters of cardinality 1. 7.5 Outro 7.5.1 Remarks Unsupervised learning is often performed during the data pre-processing and exploration stage. Assessing the quality of clustering is particularly challenging as, unlike in a supervised setting, we have no access to “ground truth” information. In practice, we often apply different clustering algorithms and just see where they lead us. There’s no teacher that would tell us what we should do, so whatever we do is awesome, right? Well, not precisely. Most frequently, you, my dear reader, will work for some party that’s genuinely interested in your explaining why did you spent the last month coming up with nothing useful at all. Thus, the main body of work related to proving the use-full/less-ness will be on you. Clustering methods can aid us in supervised tasks – instead of fitting a single “large model”, it might be useful to fit separate models to each cluster. To sum up, the aim of K-means is to find \\(K\\) clusters based on the notion of the points’ closeness to the cluster centres. Remember that \\(K\\) must be set in advance. By definition (* via its relation to Voronoi diagrams), all clusters will be of convex shapes. However, we may try applying \\(K&#39;\\)-means for \\(K&#39; \\gg K\\) to obtain a “fine grained” compressed representation of data and then combine the (sub)clusters into more meaningful groups using other methods (such as the hierarchical ones). Iterative K-means algorithms are very fast (e.g., a mini-batch version of the algorithm can be implement to speed up the optimisation process) even for large data sets, but they may fail to find a desirable solution, especially if clusters are unbalanced. Hierarchical methods, on the other hand, output a whole family of mutually nested partitions, which may provide us with insight into the underlying structure of data data. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to assign new points to existing clusters; yet, you can always build a classifier (e.g., a decision tree or a neural network) that learns the discovered labels. A linkage scheme must be chosen with care, for instance, single linkage can be sensitive to outliers. However, it is generally the fastest. The methods implemented in hclust() are generally slow; they have time complexity between \\(O(n^2)\\) and \\(O(n^3)\\). Remark. Note that the fastcluster package provides a more efficient and memory-saving implementation of some methods available via a call to hclust(). See also the genieclust package for a super-robust version of the single linkage algorithm based on the datasets’s Euclidean minimum spanning tree, which can be computed quite quickly. Finally, note that all the discussed clustering methods are based on the notion of pairwise distances. These of course tend to behave weirdly in high-dimensional spaces (“the curse of dimensionality”). Moreover, some hardcore feature engineering might be needed to obtain meaningful results. 7.5.2 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (James et al. 2017: Section 10.3) Other: (Hastie et al. 2017: Section 14.3) Additionally, check out other noteworthy clustering approaches: Genie (see R package genieclust) (Gagolewski et al. 2016, Cena &amp; Gagolewski 2020) ITM (Müller et al. 2012) DBSCAN, HDBSCAN* (Ling 1973, Ester et al. 1996, Campello et al. 2015) K-medoids, K-medians Fuzzy C-means (a.k.a. weighted K-means) (Bezdek et al. 1984) Spectral clustering; e.g., (Ng et al. 2001) BIRCH (Zhang et al. 1996) References "],

There will be not much work on-going in this repository anymore, as its sources have moved elsewhere; however, if you happen to find any bugs or typos, please drop me an email. I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. 8.1 Introduction 8.1.1 Recap Recall that an optimisation task deals with finding an element \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in a search space \\(\\mathbb{D}\\), that minimises or maximises an objective function \\(f:\\mathbb{D}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\): \\[ \\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}} f(\\mathbf{x}) \\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\max_{\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{D}} f(\\mathbf{x}), \\] In one of the previous chapters, we were dealing with unconstrained continuous optimisation, i.e., we assumed the search space is \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\mathbb{R}^p\\) for some \\(p\\).   Example problems of this kind: minimising mean squared error in linear regression or minimising cross-entropy in logistic regression. The class of general-purpose iterative algorithms we’ve previously studied fit into the following scheme: \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}\\) – initial guess (e.g., generated at random) for \\(i=1,...,M\\): \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)}+\\text{[guessed direction, e.g.,}-\\eta\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\text{]}\\) if \\(|f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})-f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i-1)})| &lt; \\varepsilon\\) break return \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\\) as result where: \\(M\\) = maximum number of iterations \\(\\varepsilon\\) = tolerance, e.g, \\(10^{-8}\\) \\(\\eta&gt;0\\) = learning rate The algorithms such as gradient descent and BFGS (see optim()) give satisfactory results in the case of smooth and well-behaving objective functions. However, if an objective has, e.g., many plateaus (regions where it is almost constant), those methods might easily get stuck in local minima. The K-means clustering’s objective function is a not particularly pleasant one – it involves a nested search for the closest cluster, with the use of the \\(\\min\\) operator. 8.1.2 K-means Revisited In K-means clustering we are minimising the squared Euclidean distance to each point’s cluster centre: \\[ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\min_{k=1,\\dots,K} \\sum_{j=1}^p \\left(x_{i,j}-\\mu_{k,j}\\right)^2 \\right). \\] This is an (NP-)hard problem! There is no efficient exact algorithm. We need approximations. In the last chapter, we have discussed the iterative Lloyd’s algorithm (1957), which is amongst a few procedures implemented in the kmeans() function. To recall, Lloyd’s algorithm (1957) is sometimes referred to as “the” K-means algorithm: Start with random cluster centres \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{1,\\cdot}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol\\mu_{K,\\cdot}\\). For each point \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,\\cdot}\\), determine its closest centre \\(C(i)\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\). For each cluster \\(k\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\), compute the new cluster centre \\(\\boldsymbol\\mu_{k,\\cdot}\\) as the componentwise arithmetic mean of the coordinates of all the point indices \\(i\\) such that \\(C(i)=k\\). If the cluster centres changed since last iteration, go to step 2, otherwise stop and return the result.   As the procedure might get stuck in a local minimum, a few restarts are recommended (as usual). Hence, we are used to calling: kmeans(X, centers=k, nstart=10) 8.1.3 optim() vs. kmeans() Let us compare how a general-purpose optimiser such as the BFGS algorithm implemented in optim() compares with a customised, problem-specific solver. We will need some benchmark data. gen_cluster &lt;- function(n, p, m, s) { vectors &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow=n, ncol=p) unit_vectors &lt;- vectors/sqrt(rowSums(vectors^2)) unit_vectors*rnorm(n, 0, s)+rep(m, each=n) } The above function generates \\(n\\) points in \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\) from a distribution centred at \\(\\mathbf{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^p\\), spread randomly in every possible direction with scale factor \\(s\\). Two example clusters in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\): # plot the &quot;black&quot; cluster plot(gen_cluster(500, 2, c(0, 0), 1), col=&quot;#00000022&quot;, pch=16, xlim=c(-3, 4), ylim=c(-3, 4), asp=1, ann=FALSE) # plot the &quot;red&quot; cluster points(gen_cluster(250, 2, c(1.5, 1), 0.5), col=&quot;#ff000022&quot;, pch=16) (#fig:gendata_example) plot of chunk gendata_example Let’s generate the benchmark dataset \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) that consists of three clusters in a high-dimensional space. set.seed(123) p &lt;- 32 Ns &lt;- c(50, 100, 20) Ms &lt;- c(0, 1, 2) s &lt;- 1.5*p K &lt;- length(Ns) X &lt;- lapply(1:K, function(k) gen_cluster(Ns[k], p, rep(Ms[k], p), s)) X &lt;- do.call(rbind, X) # rbind(X[[1]], X[[2]], X[[3]]) The objective function for the K-means clustering problem: library(&quot;FNN&quot;) get_loss &lt;- function(mu, X) { # For each point in X, # get the index of the closest point in mu: memb &lt;- FNN::get.knnx(mu, X, 1)$nn.index # compute the sum of squared distances # between each point and its closes cluster centre: sum((X-mu[memb,])^2) } Setting up the solvers: min_HartiganWong &lt;- function(mu0, X) get_loss( # algorithm=&quot;Hartigan-Wong&quot; kmeans(X, mu0, iter.max=100)$centers, X) min_Lloyd &lt;- function(mu0, X) get_loss( kmeans(X, mu0, iter.max=100, algorithm=&quot;Lloyd&quot;)$centers, X) min_optim &lt;- function(mu0, X) optim(mu0, function(mu, X) { get_loss(matrix(mu, nrow=nrow(mu0)), X) }, X=X, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;, control=list(reltol=1e-16) )$val Running the simulation: nstart &lt;- 100 set.seed(123) res &lt;- replicate(nstart, { mu0 &lt;- X[sample(nrow(X), K),] c( HartiganWong=min_HartiganWong(mu0, X), Lloyd=min_Lloyd(mu0, X), optim=min_optim(mu0, X) ) }) Notice a considerable variability of the objective function at the local minima found: boxplot(as.data.frame(t(res)), horizontal=TRUE, col=&quot;white&quot;) Figure 8.1: plot of chunk gendata5 print(apply(res, 1, function(x) c(summary(x), sd=sd(x)) )) ## HartiganWong Lloyd optim ## Min. 421889 425119.5 422989 ## 1st Qu. 424663 433669.3 432446 ## Median 427129 438502.2 440033 ## Mean 426557 438075.0 440635 ## 3rd Qu. 428243 441381.3 446614 ## Max. 431869 450469.7 466303 ## sd 2301 5709.3 10888 Of course, we are interested in the smallest value of the objective, because we’re trying to pinpoint the global minimum. print(apply(res, 1, min)) ## HartiganWong Lloyd optim ## 421889 425119 422989 The Hartigan-Wong algorithm (the default one in kmeans()) is the most reliable one of the three: it gives the best solution (low bias) the solutions have the lowest degree of variability (low variance) it is the fastest: library(&quot;microbenchmark&quot;) set.seed(123) mu0 &lt;- X[sample(nrow(X), K),] summary(microbenchmark( HartiganWong=min_HartiganWong(mu0, X), Lloyd=min_Lloyd(mu0, X), optim=min_optim(mu0, X), times=10 ), unit=&quot;relative&quot;) ## expr min lq mean median uq ## 1 HartiganWong 1.1066 1.1052 1.1774 1.1984 1.1716 ## 2 Lloyd 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 ## 3 optim 1637.6214 1639.4981 1577.0414 1612.6708 1503.2987 ## max neval ## 1 1.3662 10 ## 2 1.0000 10 ## 3 1516.5368 10 print(min(res)) ## [1] 421889 Is it the global minimum? We don’t know, we just didn’t happen to find anything better (yet). Did we put enough effort to find it? Well, maybe.

It depends what we’d like to do with this. Does it make your boss happy? Does it generate revenue? Does it help solve any other problem? Is it useful anyhow? Are you really looking for the global minimum? 8.2 Genetic Algorithms 8.2.1 Introduction What if our optimisation problem cannot be solved reliably with gradient-based methods like those in optim() and we don’t have any custom solver for the task at hand? There are a couple of useful metaheuristics in the literature that can serve this purpose. Most of them rely on clever randomised search. They are slow to run and don’t guarantee anything, but yet they still might be useful – some claim that a solution is better than no solution at all. There is a wide class of nature-inspired algorithms (that traditionally belong to the subfield of AI called computational intelligence or soft computing); see, e.g, (Simon 2013): evolutionary algorithms – inspired by the principle of natural selection maintain a population of candidate solutions, let the “fittest” combine with each other to generate new “offspring” solutions. swarm algorithms maintain a herd of candidate solutions, allow them to “explore” the environment, “communicate” with each other in order to seek the best spot to “go to”. For example: ant colony bees cuckoo search particle swarm krill herd other metaheuristics: harmony search memetic algorithm firefly algorithm All of these sound fancy, but the general ideas behind them are pretty simple. 8.2.2 Overview of the Method Genetic algorithms (GAs) are amongst the most popular evolutionary approaches. They are based on Charles Darwin’s work on evolution by natural selection; first proposed by John Holland in the 1960s. See (Goldberg, 1989) for a comprehensive overview and (Simon, 2013) for extensions. Here is the general idea of a GA (there might be many) to minimise a given objective/loss function \\(f\\) over a given domain \\(D\\). Generate a random initial population of individuals – \\(n_\\text{pop}\\) points in \\(D\\), e.g., \\(n_\\text{pop}=32\\) Repeat until some convergence criterion is not met: evaluate the fitness of each individual (the smaller the loss, the greater its fitness) select the pairs of the individuals for reproduction, the fitter should be selected more eagerly apply crossover operations to create offspring slightly mutate randomly selected individuals replace the old population with the new one 8.2.3 Example Implementation - GA for K-means Initial setup: set.seed(123) # simulation parameters: npop &lt;- 32 niter &lt;- 100 # randomly generate an initial population of size `npop`: pop &lt;- lapply(1:npop, function(i) X[sample(nrow(X), K),]) # evaluate loss for each individual: cur_loss &lt;- sapply(pop, get_loss, X) cur_best_loss &lt;- min(cur_loss) best_loss &lt;- cur_best_loss Each individual in the population is just the set of \\(K\\) candidate cluster centres represented as a matrix in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times p}\\). Let’s assume that the loss for each individual should be a function of the rank of the objective function’s value (smallest objective/loss == highest rank/utility/fitness == best fit). For the crossover, we will sample pairs of individuals with probabilities inversely proportional to their losses. selection &lt;- function(cur_loss) { npop &lt;- length(cur_loss) probs &lt;- rank(-cur_loss) probs &lt;- probs/sum(probs) left &lt;- sample(npop, npop, replace=TRUE, prob=probs) right &lt;- sample(npop, npop, replace=TRUE, prob=probs) cbind(left, right) } An example crossover combines each cluster centre in such a way that we take a few coordinates of the “left” parent and the remaining ones from the “right” parent: Figure 8.2: Crossover crossover &lt;- function(pop, pairs, K, p) { old_pop &lt;- pop pop &lt;- pop[pairs[,2]] for (j in 1:length(pop)) { wh &lt;- sample(p-1, K, replace=TRUE) for (l in 1:K) pop[[j]][l,1:wh[l]] &lt;- old_pop[[pairs[j,1]]][l,1:wh[l]] } pop } Mutation (occurring with a very small probability) substitutes some cluster centre with a random vector from the input dataset. mutate &lt;- function(pop, X, K) { for (j in 1:length(pop)) { if (runif(1) &lt; 0.025) { szw &lt;- sample(1:K, 1) pop[[j]][szw,] &lt;- X[sample(nrow(X), length(szw)),] } } pop } We also need a function that checks if the new cluster centres aren’t too far away from the input points. If it happens that we have empty clusters, our solution is degenerate and we must correct it. All “bad” cluster centres will be substituted with randomly chosen points from \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). Moreover, we will recompute the cluster centres as the componentwise arithmetic mean of the closest points, just like in Lloyd’s algorithm, to speed up convergence. recompute_mus &lt;- function(pop, X, K) { for (j in 1:length(pop)) { # get nearest cluster centres for each point: memb &lt;- get.knnx(pop[[j]], X, 1)$nn.index sz &lt;- tabulate(memb, K) # number of points in each cluster # if there are empty clusters, fix them: szw &lt;- which(sz==0) if (length(szw)&gt;0) { # random points in X will be new cluster centres pop[[j]][szw,] &lt;- X[sample(nrow(X), length(szw)),] memb &lt;- FNN::get.knnx(pop[[j]], X, 1)$nn.index sz &lt;- tabulate(memb, K) } # recompute cluster centres - componentwise average: pop[[j]][,] &lt;- 0 for (l in 1:nrow(X)) pop[[j]][memb[l],] &lt;- pop[[j]][memb[l],]+X[l,] pop[[j]] &lt;- pop[[j]]/sz } pop } We are ready to build our genetic algorithm to solve the K-means clustering problem: for (i in 1:niter) { pairs &lt;- selection(cur_loss) pop &lt;- crossover(pop, pairs, K, p) pop &lt;- mutate(pop, X, K) pop &lt;- recompute_mus(pop, X, K) # re-evaluate losses: cur_loss &lt;- sapply(pop, get_loss, X) cur_best_loss &lt;- min(cur_loss) # give feedback on what&#39;s going on: if (cur_best_loss &lt; best_loss) { best_loss &lt;- cur_best_loss best_mu &lt;- pop[[which.min(cur_loss)]] cat(sprintf(&quot;%5d: f_best=%10.5f\\n&quot;, i, best_loss)) } } ## 1: f_best=435638.52165 ## 2: f_best=428808.89706 ## 4: f_best=428438.45125 ## 6: f_best=422277.99136 ## 8: f_best=421889.46265 print(get_loss(best_mu, X)) ## [1] 421889 print(get_loss(res_tried_very_hard, X)) ## [1] 421889 It works! :) 8.3 Outro 8.3.1 Remarks For any \\(p\\ge 1\\), the search space type determines the problem class: \\(\\mathbb{D}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^p\\) – continuous optimisation In particular: \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\mathbb{R}^p\\) – continuous unconstrained \\(\\mathbb{D}=[a_1,b_1]\\times\\dots\\times[a_n,b_n]\\) – continuous with box constraints constrained with \\(k\\) linear inequality constraints \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lll} a_{1,1} x_1 + \\dots + a_{1,p} x_p &amp;\\le&amp; b_1 \\\\ &amp;\\vdots&amp;\\\\ a_{k,1} x_1 + \\dots + a_{k,p} x_p &amp;\\le&amp; b_k \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] However, there are other possibilities as well: \\(\\mathbb{D}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}^p\\) (\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) – the set of integers) – discrete optimisation In particular: \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\{0,1\\}^p\\) – 0–1 optimisation (hard!) \\(\\mathbb{D}\\) is finite (but perhaps large, its objects can be enumerated) – combination optimisation For example: \\(\\mathbb{D}=\\) all possible routes between two points on a map. These optimisation tasks tend to be much harder than the continuous ones. Genetic algorithms might come in handy in such cases. Specialised methods, customised to solve a specific problem (like Lloyd’s algorithm) will often outperform generic ones (like SGD, genetic algorithms) in terms of speed and reliability. All in all, we prefer a suboptimal solution obtained by means of heuristics to no solution at all. Problems that you could try solving with GAs include variable selection in multiple regression – finding the subset of features optimising the AIC (this is a hard problem to and forward selection was just a simple greed heuristic). Other interesting algorithms: Hill Climbing (a simple variation of GD with no gradient use) Simulated annealing CMA-ES Tabu search Particle swarm optimisation (e.g, hydroPSO package) Artificial bee/ant colony optimisation Cuckoo Search Differential Evolution (e.g., DEoptim package) 8.3.2 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (Goldberg 1989) Other: (Simon 2013) See also package GA.

I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. 9.1 Introduction Recommender (recommendation) systems aim to predict the rating a user would give to an item. For example: playlist generators (Spotify, YouTube, Netflix, …), content recommendations (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Apple News, …), product recommendations (Amazon, Alibaba, …). Implementing recommender systems, according to (Ricci et al. 2011), might: increase the number of items sold, increase users’ satisfaction, increase users’ fidelity, allow a company to sell more diverse items, allow to better understand what users want. Exercise. Think of the last time you found some recommendation useful. They can also increase the users’ frustration. Exercise. Think of the last time you found a recommendation useless and irritating. What might be the reasons why you have been provided with such a suggestion? 9.1.1 The Netflix Prize In 2006 Netflix (back then a DVD rental company) released one of the most famous benchmark sets for recommender systems, which helped boost the research on algorithms in this field. See https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data; data archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20090925184737/http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Netflix+Prize and https://archive.org/details/nf_prize_dataset.tar The dataset consists of: 480,189 users 17,770 movies 100,480,507 ratings in the training sample: MovieID CustomerID Rating from 1 to 5 Title YearOfRelease from 1890 to 2005 Date of rating in the range 1998-11-01 to 2005-12-31 The quiz set consists of 1,408,342 ratings and it was used by the competitors to assess the quality of their algorithms and compute the leaderboard scores. Root mean squared error (RMSE) of predicted vs. true rankings was chosen as a performance metric. The test set of 1,408,789 ratings (not make publicly available) was used to determine the winner. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos team which improved over the Netflix’s Cinematch algorithm by 10.06%, achieving the winning RMSE of 0.8567 on the test subset. 9.1.2 Main Approaches Current recommender systems are quite complex and use a fusion of various approaches, also those based on external knowledge bases. However, we may distinguish at least two core approaches, see (Ricci et al. 2011) for more: Collaborative Filtering is based on the assumption that if two people interact with the same product, they’re likely to have other interests in common as well. John and Mary both like bananas and apples and dislike spinach. John likes sushi. Mary hasn’t tried sushi yet. It seems they might have similar tastes, so we recommend that Mary should give sushi a try. Content-based Filtering builds users’ profiles that represent information about what kind of products they like. We have discovered that John likes fruit but dislikes vegetables. An orange is a fruit (an item similar to those he liked in the past) with which John is yet to interact. Thus, it is suggested that John should give it a try. Jim Bennett, at that time the vice president of recommendation systems at Netflix on the idea behind the original Cinematch algorithm (see https://www.technologyreview.com/s/406637/the-1-million-netflix-challenge/ and https://web.archive.org/web/20070821194257/http://www.netflixprize.com/faq): First, you collect 100 million user ratings for about 18,000 movies. Take any two movies and find the people who have rated both of them. Then look to see if the people who rate one of the movies highly rate the other one highly, if they liked one and not the other, or if they didn’t like either movie. Based on their ratings, Cinematch sees whether there’s a correlation between those people. Now, do this for all possible pairs of 65,000 movies. Exercise. Is the above an example of the collaborative or context-based filtering? 9.1.3 Formalism Let \\(\\mathcal{U}=\\{ U_1,\\dots,U_n \\}\\) denote the set of \\(n\\) users. Let \\(\\mathcal{I}=\\{ I_1,\\dots,I_p \\}\\) denote the set of \\(p\\) items. Let \\(\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) be a user-item matrix such that: \\[ r_{u,i}=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} r &amp; \\text{if the $u$-th user ranked the $i$-th item as $r&gt;0$}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if the $u$-th user hasn&#39;t interacted with the $i$-th item yet}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Remark. Note that 0 is used to denote a missing value (NA) here. In particular, we can assume: \\(r_{u,i}\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,5\\}\\) (ratings on the scale 1–5 or no interaction) \\(r_{u,i}\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) (“Like” or no interaction) The aim of an recommender system is to predict the rating \\(\\hat{r}_{u,i}\\) that the \\(u\\)-th user would give to the \\(i\\)-th item provided that currently \\(r_{u,i}=0\\). 9.2 Collaborative Filtering 9.2.1 Example . Apple Banana Sushi Spinach Orange Anne 1 5 5 1 Beth 1 1 5 5 1 John 5 5 1 Kate 1 1 5 5 1 Mark 5 5 1 1 5 Sara ? 5 ? 5 In user-based collaborative filtering, we seek users with similar preference profiles/rating patters. “User A has similar behavioural patterns as user B, so A should suggested with what B likes.” In item-based collaborative filtering, we seek items with similar (dis)likeability structure. “Users who (dis)liked X also (dis)liked Y”. Exercise. Will Sara enjoy her spinach? Will Sara enjoy her apple? An example \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) matrix in R: R &lt;- matrix( c( 1, 5, 5, 0, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5 ), byrow=TRUE, nrow=6, ncol=5, dimnames=list( c(&quot;Anne&quot;, &quot;Beth&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Kate&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Sara&quot;), c(&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Sushi&quot;, &quot;Spinach&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;) ) ) R ## Apple Banana Sushi Spinach Orange ## Anne 1 5 5 0 1 ## Beth 1 1 5 5 1 ## John 5 5 0 1 0 ## Kate 1 1 5 5 1 ## Mark 5 5 1 1 5 ## Sara 0 5 0 0 5 9.2.2 Similarity Measures Assuming \\(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}\\) are two sequences of length \\(k\\) (in our setting, \\(k\\) is equal to either \\(n\\) or \\(p\\)), let \\(S\\) be the following similarity measure between two rating vectors: \\[ S(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}) = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^k a_i b_i }{ \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^k a_i^2 } \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^k b_i^2 } } \\] cosim &lt;- function(a, b) sum(a*b)/sqrt(sum(a^2)*sum(b^2)) We call it the cosine similarity. We have \\(S(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b})\\in[-1,1]\\), where we get \\(1\\) for two identical elements. Similarity of 0 is obtained for two unrelated (“orthogonal”) vectors. For nonnegative sequences, negative similarities are not generated. (*) Another frequently considered similarity measure is a version of the Pearson correlation coefficient that ignores all \\(0\\)-valued observations, see also the use argument to the cor() function. 9.2.3 User-Based Collaborative Filtering User-based approaches involve comparing each user against every other user (pairwise comparisons of the rows in \\(\\mathbf{R}\\)). This yields a similarity degree between the \\(i\\)-th and the \\(j\\)-th user: \\[ s^U_{i,j} = S(\\mathbf{r}_{i,\\cdot},\\mathbf{r}_{j,\\cdot}). \\] SU &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=nrow(R), ncol=nrow(R), dimnames=dimnames(R)[c(1,1)]) # and empty n*n matrix for (i in 1:nrow(R)) { for (j in 1:nrow(R)) { SU[i,j] &lt;- cosim(R[i,], R[j,]) } } round(SU, 2) ## Anne Beth John Kate Mark Sara ## Anne 1.00 0.61 0.58 0.61 0.63 0.59 ## Beth 0.61 1.00 0.29 1.00 0.39 0.19 ## John 0.58 0.29 1.00 0.29 0.81 0.50 ## Kate 0.61 1.00 0.29 1.00 0.39 0.19 ## Mark 0.63 0.39 0.81 0.39 1.00 0.81 ## Sara 0.59 0.19 0.50 0.19 0.81 1.00 In order to obtain the previously unobserved rating \\(\\hat{r}_{u,i}\\) using the user-based approach, we typically look for the \\(K\\) most similar users and aggregate their corresponding scores (for some \\(K\\ge 1\\)). More formally, let \\(\\{U_{v_1},\\dots,U_{v_K}\\}\\in\\mathcal{U}\\setminus\\{U_u\\}\\) be the set of users maximising \\(s^U_{u, v_1}, \\dots, s^U_{u, v_K}\\) and having \\(r_{v_1, i},\\dots,r_{v_K, i}&gt;0\\). Then: \\[ \\hat{r}_{u,i} = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^K r_{v_\\ell, i}. \\] Remark. The arithmetic mean can be replaced with, e.g., the more or a weighted arithmetic mean where weights are proportional to \\(s^U_{u, v_\\ell}\\) This is very similar to the \\(K\\)-nearest neighbour heuristic!

Hence, a similarity degree between the \\(i\\)-th and the \\(j\\)-th item is given by: \\[ s^I_{i,j} = S(\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,i},\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,j}). \\] SI &lt;- matrix(0, nrow=ncol(R), ncol=ncol(R), dimnames=dimnames(R)[c(2,2)]) # an empty p*p matrix for (i in 1:ncol(R)) { for (j in 1:ncol(R)) { SI[i,j] &lt;- cosim(R[,i], R[,j]) } } round(SI, 2) ## Apple Banana Sushi Spinach Orange ## Apple 1.00 0.78 0.32 0.38 0.53 ## Banana 0.78 1.00 0.45 0.27 0.78 ## Sushi 0.32 0.45 1.00 0.81 0.32 ## Spinach 0.38 0.27 0.81 1.00 0.29 ## Orange 0.53 0.78 0.32 0.29 1.00 In order to obtain the previously unobserved rating \\(\\hat{r}_{u,i}\\) using the item-based approach, we typically look for the \\(K\\) most similar items and aggregate their corresponding scores (for some \\(K\\ge 1\\)) More formally, let \\(\\{I_{j_1},\\dots,I_{j_K}\\}\\in\\mathcal{I}\\setminus\\{I_i\\}\\) be the set of items maximising \\(s^I_{i, j_1}, \\dots, s^I_{i, j_K}\\) and having \\(r_{u, j_1},\\dots,r_{u, j_K}&gt;0\\). Then: \\[ \\hat{r}_{u,i} = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^K r_{u, j_\\ell}. \\] Remark. Similarly to the previous case, the arithmetic mean can be replaced with, e.g., the mode or a weighted arithmetic mean where weights are proportional to \\(s^I_{i, j_\\ell}\\).

The dataset consists of ca. 100,000 ratings to 9,000 movies by 600 users. It was last updated on September 2018. This is already a pretty large dataset!

We will re-map the movieIds to consecutive integers. # the list of all rated movieIds: movieId2 &lt;- unique(ratings$movieId) # max user Id (these could&#39;ve been cleaned up too): (n &lt;- max(ratings$userId)) ## [1] 610 # number of unique movies: (p &lt;- length(movieId2)) ## [1] 9724 # remove unrated movies: movies &lt;- movies[movies$movieId %in% movieId2, ] # we&#39;ll map movieId2[i] to i for each i=1,...,p: movies$movieId &lt;- match(movies$movieId, movieId2) ratings$movieId &lt;- match(ratings$movieId, movieId2) # order the movies by the new movieId so that # the movie with Id==i is in the i-th row: movies &lt;- movies[order(movies$movieId),] stopifnot(all(movies$movieId == 1:p)) # sanity check We will use a sparse matrix data type (from R package Matrix) to store the ratings data, \\(\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\). Remark. Sparse matrices contain many zeros. Instead of storing all the \\(np=5931640\\) elements, only the lists of non-zero ones are saved, \\(100836\\) values in total. This way, we might save a lot of memory. The drawback is that, amongst others, random access to the elements in a sparse matrix takes more time. library(&quot;Matrix&quot;) R &lt;- Matrix(0.0, sparse=TRUE, nrow=n, ncol=p) # This is a vectorised operation; # it is faster than a for loop over each row # in the ratings matrix: R[cbind(ratings$userId, ratings$movieId)] &lt;- ratings$rating Let’s preview a few first rows and columns: R[1:6, 1:18] ## 6 x 18 sparse Matrix of class &quot;dgCMatrix&quot; ## ## [1,] 4 4 4 5 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 5 3 5 4 5 3 3 ## [2,] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ## [3,] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ## ## .............................. ## ........suppressing 1 rows in show(); maybe adjust &#39;options(max.print= *, width = *)&#39; ## .............................. ## ## [5,] 4 . . . 4 . . 4 . . . . . . . . 5 2 ## [6,] . 5 4 4 1 . . 5 4 . 3 4 . 3 . . 2 5 9.3.3 Item-Item Similarities To recall, the cosine similarity between \\(\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,i},\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is given by: \\[ s_{i,j}^I = S_C(\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,i},\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,j}) = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^n r_{k,i} \\, r_{k,j}}{ \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^n r_{k,i}^2}\\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^n r_{k,j}^2} } \\] In vector/matrix algebra notation, this is: \\[ s_{i,j}^I = S_C(\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,i},\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,j}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,i}^T\\, \\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,j}}{ \\sqrt{{\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,i}^T\\, \\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,i}}} \\sqrt{{\\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,j}^T\\, \\mathbf{r}_{\\cdot,j}}} } \\] As \\(\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\), we can “almost” compute all the \\(p\\times p\\) cosine similarities at once by applying: \\[ \\mathbf{S}^I = \\frac{\\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{R}}{ \\dots } \\] Cosine similarities for item-item comparisons: norms &lt;- as.matrix(sqrt(colSums(R^2))) Rx &lt;- as.matrix(crossprod(R, R)) SI &lt;- Rx/tcrossprod(norms) SI[is.nan(SI)] &lt;- 0 # there were some divisions by zero Remark. crossprod(A,B) gives \\(\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{B}\\) and tcrossprod(A,B) gives \\(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}^T\\). 9.3.4 Example Recommendations recommend &lt;- function(i, K, SI, movies) { # get K most similar movies to the i-th one ms &lt;- order(SI[i,], decreasing=TRUE) data.frame( Title=movies$title[ms[1:K]], SIC=SI[i,ms[1:K]] ) } movies$title[1215] ## [1] &quot;Monty Python&#39;s The Meaning of Life (1983)&quot; recommend(1215, 10, SI, movies) ## Title SIC ## 1 Monty Python&#39;s The Meaning of Life (1983) 1.00000 ## 2 Monty Python&#39;s Life of Brian (1979) 0.61097 ## 3 Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) 0.51415 ## 4 House of Flying Daggers (Shi mian mai fu) (2004) 0.49322 ## 5 Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, The (2005) 0.45482 ## 6 Bowling for Columbine (2002) 0.45051 ## 7 Shaun of the Dead (2004) 0.44566 ## 8 O Brother, Where Art Thou?

Thus, a cosine similarity matrix can be turned into a dissimilarity matrix: DI &lt;- 1.0-SI DI[DI&lt;0] &lt;- 0.0 # account for numeric inaccuracies DI &lt;- as.dist(DI) This enables us to perform, e.g., the cluster analysis of items: library(&quot;genie&quot;) ## Loading required package: genieclust h &lt;- hclust2(DI) plot(h, labels=FALSE, ann=FALSE); box() Figure 9.1: Cluster dendrogram for the movies A 14-partition might look nice, let’s give it a try: c &lt;- cutree(h, k=14) Example movies in the 3rd cluster: Bottle Rocket (1996), Clerks (1994), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Swingers (1996), Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Princess Bride, The (1987), Raiders of the Lost Ark (Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark) (1981), Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), Blues Brothers, The (1980), Duck Soup (1933), Groundhog Day (1993), Back to the Future (1985), Young Frankenstein (1974), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997), Men in Black (a.k.a.

Not a single algorithm, but an ensemble (a proper combination) of different approaches is often used in practice, see the Further Reading section below for the detailed information of the Netflix Prize winners. Recommender systems are an interesting fusion of the techniques we have already studied – linear models, K-nearest neighbours etc. Building recommender systems is challenging, because data is large yet often sparse. For instance, the ratio of available ratings vs. all possible user-item valuations for the Netflix Prize (obviously, it is just a sample of the complete dataset that Netflix has) is equal to: 100480507/(480189*17770) ## [1] 0.011776 A sparse matrix (see R package Matrix) data structure is often used for storing of and computing over such data effectively. Note that some users are biased in the sense that they are more critical or enthusiastic than average users. Exercise. Is 3 stars a “bad”, “fair enough” or “good” rating for you? Would you go to a bar/restaurant ranked 3.0 by you favourite Maps app community? It is particularly challenging to predict the preferences of users that cast few ratings, e.g., those who just signed up (the cold start problem). “Hill et al. [1995] have shown that users provide inconsistent ratings when asked to rate the same movie at different times. They suggest that an algorithm cannot be more accurate than the variance in a user’s ratings for the same item.” (Herlocker et al. 2004: p. 6) It is good to take into account the temporal (time-based) characteristics of data as well as external knowledge (e.g., how long ago a rating was cast, what is a film’s genre). The presented approaches are vulnerable to attacks – bots may be used to promote or inhibit selected items. 9.4.2 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (Herlocker et al. 2004), (Ricci et al. 2011), (Lü &amp; others 2012), (Harper &amp; Konstan 2015).

There will be not much work on-going in this repository anymore, as its sources have moved elsewhere; however, if you happen to find any bugs or typos, please drop me an email. I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. B.1 Installing R R and Python are the languages of modern data science. The former is slightly more oriented towards data modelling, analysis and visualisation as well as statistical computing. It has a gentle learning curve, which makes is very suitable even for beginners – just like us! R is available for Windows as well as MacOS, Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It can be downloaded from the R project website, see https://www.r-project.org/ (or installed through system-specific package repositories). Remark. From now on we assume that you have installed the R environment. B.2 Installing an IDE As we wish to make our first steps with the R language as stress- and hassle-free as possible, let’s stick to a very user-friendly development environment called RStudio, which can be downloaded from https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ (choose RStudio Desktop Open Source Edition). Remark. There are of course many other options for working with R, both interactive and non-interactive, including Jupyter Notebooks (see https://irkernel.github.io/), dynamically generated reports (see https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) and plain shell scripts executed from a terminal. However, for now let’s leave that to more advanced users. B.3 Installing Recommended Packages Once we get the above up and running, from within RStudio, we need to install a few packages which we’re going to use during the course of this course. Execute the following commands in the R console (bottom-left Rstudio pane): pkgs &lt;- c(&quot;Cairo&quot;, &quot;DEoptim&quot;, &quot;fastcluster&quot;, &quot;FNN&quot;, &quot;genie&quot;, &quot;genieclust&quot;, &quot;gsl&quot;, &quot;hydroPSO&quot;, &quot;ISLR&quot;, &quot;keras&quot;, &quot;Matrix&quot;, &quot;microbenchmark&quot;, &quot;pdist&quot;, &quot;RColorBrewer&quot;, &quot;recommenderlab&quot;, &quot;rpart&quot;, &quot;rpart.plot&quot;, &quot;rworldmap&quot;, &quot;scatterplot3d&quot;, &quot;stringi&quot;, &quot;tensorflow&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;titanic&quot;, &quot;vioplot&quot;) install.packages(pkgs) What is more, in order to be able to play with neural networks, we will need some Python environment, for example the Anaconda Distribution Python 3.x, see https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. Remark. Do not download Python 2.7. Installation instructions can be found at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. This is required for the R packages tensorflow and keras, see https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation/. Once this is installed, execute the following R commands in the console: library(&quot;tensorflow&quot;) install_tensorflow() B.4 First R Script in RStudio Let’s open RStudio and perform the following steps: Create a New Project where we will store all the scripts related to this book. Click File → New Project and then choose to start in a brand new working directory, in any location you like. Choose New Project as the project type. From now on, we are assuming that the project name is LMLCR and the project has been opened. All source files we create will be relative to the project directory. Create a new R source file, File → New File → R Script. Save the file as, for example, sandbox_01.R. The source editor (top left pane) behaves just like any other text editor. Standard keyboard shortcuts are available, such as CTRL+C and CTRL+V (Cmd+C and Cmd+V on MacOS) for copy and paste, respectively. A list of keyboard shortcuts is available at https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts Input the following R code into the editor: # My first R script # This is a comment # Another comment # Everything from &#39;#&#39; to the end of the line # is ignored by the R interpreter print(&quot;Hello world&quot;) # prints a given character string print(2+2) # evaluates the expression and prints the result x &lt;- seq(0, 10, length.out=100) # a new numeric vector y &lt;- x^2 # squares every element in x plot(x, y, las=1, type=&quot;l&quot;) # plots y as a function of x Execute the 5 above commands, line by line, by positioning the keyboard cursor accordingly and pressing Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Return on MacOS). Each time, the command will be copied to the console (bottom-left pane) and evaluated. The last line generates a nice plot which will appear in the bottom-right pane. While you learn, we recommend that you get used to writing your code in an R script and executing it just as we did above. On a side note, you can execute (source) the whole script by pressing Ctrl+Shift+S (Cmd+Shift+S on MacOS). "],

I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. This chapter is a step-by-step guide to vector computations in R. It also explains the basic mathematical notation around vectors. You’re encouraged to not only simply read the chapter, but also to execute yourself the R code provided. Play with it, do some experiments, get curious about how R works. Read the documentation on the functions you are calling, e.g., ?seq, ?sample and so on. Technical and mathematical literature isn’t belletristic. It requires active (pro-active even) thinking. Sometimes going through a single page can take an hour. Or a day. If you don’t understand something, keep thinking, go back, ask yourself questions, take a look at other sources. This is not a linear process. This is what makes it fun and creative. To become a good programmer you need a lot of practice, there are no shortcuts. But the whole endeavour is worth the hassle! C.1 Motivation Vector and matrix algebra provides us with a convenient language for expressing computations on sequential and tabular data. Vector and matrix algebra operations are supported by every major programming language – either natively (e.g., R, Matlab, GNU Octave, Mathematica) or via an additional library/package (e.g, Python with numpy, tensorflow, or pytorch; C++ with Eigen/Armadillo; C, C++ or Fortran with LAPACK). By using matrix notation, we generate more concise and readable code. For instance, given two vectors \\(\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}=(y_1,\\dots,y_n)\\) like: x &lt;- c(1.5, 3.5, 2.3,-6.5) y &lt;- c(2.9, 8.2,-0.1, 0.8) Instead of writing: s &lt;- 0 n &lt;- length(x) for (i in 1:n) s &lt;- s + (x[i]-y[i])^2 sqrt(s) ## [1] 9.1159 to mean: \\[ \\sqrt{ (x_1-y_1)^2 + (x_2-y_2)^2 + \\dots + (x_n-y_n)^2 } = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}, \\] which denotes the (Euclidean) distance between the two vectors (the square root of the sum of squared differences between the corresponding elements in \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\)), we shall soon become used to writing: sqrt(sum((x-y)^2)) ## [1] 9.1159 or: \\[ \\sqrt{(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y})^{T}(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y})} \\] or even: \\[ \\|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y}\\|_2 \\] In order to be able to read this notation, we only have to get to know the most common “building blocks”. There are just a few of them, but it’ll take some time until we become comfortable with their use. What’s more, we should note that vectorised code might be much faster than the for loop-based one (a.k.a. “iterative” style): library(&quot;microbenchmark&quot;) n &lt;- 10000 x &lt;- runif(n) # n random numbers in [0,1] y &lt;- runif(n) print(microbenchmark( t1={ # &quot;iterative&quot; style s &lt;- 0 n &lt;- length(x) for (i in 1:n) s &lt;- s + (x[i]-y[i])^2 sqrt(s) }, t2={ # &quot;vectorised&quot; style sqrt(sum((x-y)^2)) } ), signif=3, unit=&#39;relative&#39;) ## Unit: relative ## expr min lq mean median uq max neval ## t1 121 114 104 111 111 81.6 100 ## t2 1 1 1 1 1 1.0 100 C.2 Numeric Vectors C.2.1 Creating Numeric Vectors First let’s introduce a few ways with which we can create numeric vectors. C.2.1.1 c() The c() function combines a given list of values to form a sequence: c(1, 2, 3) ## [1] 1 2 3 c(1, 2, 3, c(4, 5), c(6, c(7, 8))) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Note that when we use the assignment operator, &lt;- or = (both are equivalent), printing of the output is suppressed: x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) # doesn&#39;t print anything print(x) ## [1] 1 2 3 However, we can enforce it by parenthesising the whole expression: (x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)) ## [1] 1 2 3 In order to determine that x is indeed a numeric vector, we call: mode(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(x) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; Remark. These two functions might return different results. For instance, in the next chapter we note that a numeric matrix will yield mode() of numeric and class() of matrix. What is more, we can get the number of elements in x by calling: length(x) ## [1] 3 C.2.1.2 seq() To create an arithmetic progression, i.e., a sequence of equally-spaced numbers, we can call the seq() function seq(1, 9, 2) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 If we access the function’s documentation (by executing ?seq in the console), we’ll note that the function takes a couple of parameters: from, to, by, length.out etc. The above call is equivalent to: seq(from=1, to=9, by=2) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 The by argument can be replaced with length.out, which gives the desired size: seq(0, 1, length.out=5) ## [1] 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Note that R supports partial matching of argument names: seq(0, 1, len=5) ## [1] 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Quite often we need progressions with step equal to 1 or -1. Such vectors can be generated by applying the : operator. 1:10 # from:to (inclusive) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -1:-10 ## [1] -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10 C.2.1.3 rep() Moreover, rep() replicates a given vector. Check out the function’s documentation (see ?rep) for the meaning of the arguments provided below. rep(1, 5) ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 rep(1:3, 4) ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 rep(1:3, c(2, 4, 3)) ## [1] 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 rep(1:3, each=4) ## [1] 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 C.2.1.4 Pseudo-Random Vectors We can also generate vectors of pseudo-random values. For instance, the following generates 5 deviates from the uniform distribution (every number has the same probability) on the unit (i.e., \\([0,1]\\)) interval: runif(5, 0, 1) ## [1] 0.56490 0.55881 0.44148 0.20764 0.66964 We call such numbers pseudo-random, because they are generated arithmetically. In fact, by setting the random number generator’s state (also called the seed), we can obtain reproducible results. set.seed(123) runif(5, 0, 1) # a,b,c,d,e ## [1] 0.28758 0.78831 0.40898 0.88302 0.94047 runif(5, 0, 1) # f,g,h,i,j ## [1] 0.045556 0.528105 0.892419 0.551435 0.456615 set.seed(123) runif(5, 0, 1) # a,b,c,d,e again! ## [1] 0.28758 0.78831 0.40898 0.88302 0.94047 Note the difference between the uniform distribution on \\([0,1]\\) and the normal distribution with expected value of \\(0\\) and standard deviation of \\(1\\) (also called the standard normal distribution), see Figure C.1. par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) # align plots in one row and two columns hist(runif(10000, 0, 1), col=&quot;white&quot;, ylim=c(0, 2500)); box() hist(rnorm(10000, 0, 1), col=&quot;white&quot;, ylim=c(0, 2500)); box() Figure C.1: Uniformly vs. normally distributed random variables Another useful function samples a number of values from a given vector, either with or without replacement: sample(1:10, 8, replace=TRUE) # with replacement ## [1] 3 3 10 2 6 5 4 6 sample(1:10, 8, replace=FALSE) # without replacement ## [1] 9 5 3 8 1 4 6 10 Note that if n is a single number, sample(n, ...) is equivalent to sample(1:n, ...). This is a dangerous behaviour than may lead to bugs in our code. Read more at ?sample. C.2.2 Vector-Scalar Operations Mathematically, we sometimes refer to a vector that is reduced to a single component as a scalar. We are used to denoting such objects with lowercase letters such as \\(a, b, i, s, x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). Remark. Note that some programming languages distinguish between atomic numerical entities and length-one vectors, e.g., 7 vs. [7] in Python. This is not the case in R, where length(7) returns 1. Vector-scalar arithmetic operations such as \\(s\\boldsymbol{x}\\) (multiplication of a vector \\(\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\dots, x_n)\\) by a scalar \\(s\\)) result in a vector \\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\) such that \\(y_i=s x_i\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). The same rule holds for, e.g., \\(s+\\boldsymbol{x}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{x}-s\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{x}/s\\). 0.5 * c(1, 10, 100) ## [1] 0.5 5.0 50.0 10 + 1:5 ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 seq(0, 10, by=2)/10 ## [1] 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 By \\(-\\boldsymbol{x}\\) we will mean \\((-1)\\boldsymbol{x}\\): -seq(0, 1, length.out=5) ## [1] 0.00 -0.25 -0.50 -0.75 -1.00 Note that in R the same rule applies for exponentiation: (0:5)^2 # synonym: (1:5)**2 ## [1] 0 1 4 9 16 25 2^(0:5) ## [1] 1 2 4 8 16 32 However, in mathematics, we are not used to writing \\(2^{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\) or \\(\\boldsymbol{x}^2\\). C.2.3 Vector-Vector Operations Let \\(\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}=(y_1,\\dots,y_n)\\) be two vectors of identical lengths. Arithmetic operations \\(\\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{y}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y}\\) are performed elementwise, i.e., they result in a vector \\(\\boldsymbol{z}\\) such that \\(z_i=x_i+y_i\\) and \\(z_i=x_i-y_i\\), respectively, \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) y &lt;- c(1, 10, 100, 1000) x+y ## [1] 2 12 103 1004 x-y ## [1] 0 -8 -97 -996 Although in mathematics we are not used to using any special notation for elementwise multiplication, division and exponentiation, this is available in R. x*y ## [1] 1 20 300 4000 x/y ## [1] 1.000 0.200 0.030 0.004 y^x ## [1] 1e+00 1e+02 1e+06 1e+12 Remark. 1e+12 is a number written in the scientific notation. It means “1 times 10 to the power of 12”, i.e., \\(1\\times 10^{12}\\). Physicists love this notation, because they are used to dealing with very small (think sizes of quarks) and very large (think distances between galaxies) entities. Moreover, in R the recycling rule is applied if we perform elementwise operations on vectors of different lengths – the shorter vector is recycled as many times as needed to match the length of the longer vector, just as if we were performing: rep(1:3, length.out=12) # recycle 1,2,3 to get 12 values ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Therefore: 1:6 * c(1) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 1:6 * c(1,10) ## [1] 1 20 3 40 5 60 1:6 * c(1,10,100) ## [1] 1 20 300 4 50 600 1:6 * c(1,10,100,1000) ## Warning in 1:6 * c(1, 10, 100, 1000): longer object length is not a ## multiple of shorter object length ## [1] 1 20 300 4000 5 60 Note that a warning is not an error – we still get a result that makes sense. C.2.4 Aggregation Functions R implements a couple of aggregation functions: sum(x) = \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i=x_1+x_2+\\dots+x_n\\) prod(x) = \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i=x_1 x_2 \\dots x_n\\) mean(x) = \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\) – arithmetic mean var(x) = sum((x-mean(x))^2)/(length(x)-1) = \\(\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(x_i - \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j \\right)^2\\) – variance sd(x) = sqrt(var(x)) – standard deviation see also: min(), max(), median(), quantile(). Remark. Remember that you can always access the R manual by typing ?functionname, e.g., ?quantile. Remark. Note that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\) can also be written as \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\) or even \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1,\\dots,n} x_i\\). These all mean the sum of \\(x_i\\) for \\(i\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\), that is, the sum of \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), …, \\(x_n\\), i.e., \\(x_1+x_2+\\dots+x_n\\). x &lt;- runif(1000) mean(x) ## [1] 0.49728 median(x) ## [1] 0.48995 min(x) ## [1] 0.00046535 max(x) ## [1] 0.9994 C.2.5 Special Functions Furthermore, R supports numerous mathematical functions, e.g., sqrt(), abs(), round(), log(), exp(), cos(), sin(). All of them are vectorised – when applied on a vector of length \\(n\\), they yield a vector of length \\(n\\) in result. For example, here is how we can compute the square roots of all the integers between 1 and 9: sqrt(1:9) ## [1] 1.0000 1.4142 1.7321 2.0000 2.2361 2.4495 2.6458 2.8284 3.0000 Vectorisation is super-convenient when it comes to, for instance, plotting (see Figure C.2). x &lt;- seq(-2*pi, 6*pi, length.out=51) plot(x, sin(x), type=&quot;l&quot;) lines(x, cos(x), col=&quot;red&quot;) # add a curve to the current plot Figure C.2: An example plot of the sine and cosine functions Exercise. Try increasing the length.out argument to make the curves smoother. C.2.6 Norms and Distances Norms are used to measure the size of an object. Mathematically, we will also be interested in the following norms: Euclidean norm: \\[ \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\| = \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 } \\] this is nothing else than the length of the vector \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) Manhattan (taxicab) norm: \\[ \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i| \\] Chebyshev (maximum) norm: \\[ \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|_\\infty = \\max_{i=1,\\dots,n} |x_i| = \\max\\{ |x_1|, |x_2|, \\dots, |x_n| \\} \\] The above norms can be easily implemented by means of the building blocks introduced above. This is super easy: z &lt;- c(1, 2) sqrt(sum(z^2)) # or norm(z, &quot;2&quot;); Euclidean ## [1] 2.2361 sum(abs(z)) # Manhattan ## [1] 3 max(abs(z)) # Chebyshev ## [1] 2 Also note that all the norms easily generate the corresponding distances (metrics) between two given points. In particular: \\[ \\| \\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y} \\| = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(x_i-y_i\\right)^2 } \\] gives the Euclidean distance (metric) between the two vectors. u &lt;- c(1, 0) v &lt;- c(1, 1) sqrt(sum((u-v)^2)) ## [1] 1 This is the “normal” distance that you learned at school. C.2.7 Dot Product (*) What is more, given two vectors of identical lengths, \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\), we define their dot product (a.k.a. scalar or inner product) as: \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i. \\] Let’s stress that this is not the same as the elementwise vector multiplication in R – the result is a single number. u &lt;- c(1, 0) v &lt;- c(1, 1) sum(u*v) ## [1] 1 Remark. (*) Note that the squared Euclidean norm of a vector is equal to the dot product of the vector and itself, \\(\\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|^2 = \\boldsymbol{x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{x}\\). (*) Interestingly, a dot product has a nice geometrical interpretation: \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{y} = \\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\| \\|\\boldsymbol{y}\\| \\cos\\alpha \\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is the angle between the two vectors. In other words, it is the product of the lengths of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. Note that we can get the cosine part by computing the dot product of the normalised vectors, i.e., such that their lengths are equal to 1. For example, the two vectors u and v defined above can be depicted as in Figure C.3. Figure C.3: Example vectors in 2D We can compute the angle between them by calling: (len_u &lt;- sqrt(sum(u^2))) # length == Euclidean norm ## [1] 1 (len_v &lt;- sqrt(sum(v^2))) ## [1] 1.4142 (cos_angle_uv &lt;- (sum(u*v)/(len_u*len_v))) # cosine of the angle ## [1] 0.70711 acos(cos_angle_uv)*180/pi # angle in degs ## [1] 45 C.2.8 Missing and Other Special Values R has a notion of a missing (not-available) value. It is very useful in data analysis, as we sometimes don’t have an information on an object’s feature. For instance, we might not know a patient’s age if he was admitted to the hospital unconscious. x &lt;- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5) Operations on missing values generally result in missing values – that makes a lot sense. x + 11:15 ## [1] 12 14 NA 18 20 mean(x) ## [1] NA If we wish to compute a vector’s aggregate after all, we can get rid of the missing values by calling na.omit(): mean(na.omit(x)) # mean of non-missing values ## [1] 3 We can also make use of the na.rm parameter of the mean() function (however, not every aggregation function has it – always refer to documentation). mean(x, na.rm=TRUE) ## [1] 3 Remark. Note that in R, a dot has no special meaning. na.omit is as good of a function’s name or variable identifier as na_omit, naOmit, NAOMIT, naomit and NaOmit. Note that, however, R is a case-sensitive language – these are all different symbols. Read more in the Details section of ?make.names. Moreover, some arithmetic operations can result in infinities (\\(\\pm \\infty\\)): log(0) ## [1] -Inf 10^1000 # too large ## [1] Inf Also, sometimes we’ll get a not-a-number, NaN. This is not a missing value, but a “invalid” result. sqrt(-1) ## Warning in sqrt(-1): NaNs produced ## [1] NaN log(-1) ## Warning in log(-1): NaNs produced ## [1] NaN Inf-Inf ## [1] NaN C.3 Logical Vectors C.3.1 Creating Logical Vectors In R there are 3 (!) logical values: TRUE, FALSE and geez, I don’t know, NA maybe? c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, NA, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE NA FALSE FALSE TRUE (x &lt;- rep(c(TRUE, FALSE, NA), 2)) ## [1] TRUE FALSE NA TRUE FALSE NA mode(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; class(x) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; length(x) ## [1] 6 Remark. By default, T is a synonym for TRUE and F for FALSE. This may be changed though so it’s better not to rely on these. C.3.2 Logical Operations Logical operators such as &amp; (and) and | (or) are performed in the same manner as arithmetic ones, i.e.: they are elementwise operations and recycling rule is applied if necessary. For example, TRUE &amp; TRUE ## [1] TRUE TRUE &amp; c(TRUE, FALSE) ## [1] TRUE FALSE c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) | c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE The ! operator stands for logical elementwise negation: !c(TRUE, FALSE) ## [1] FALSE TRUE Generally, operations on NAs yield NA unless other solution makes sense. u &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA) v &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, NA, NA, NA) u &amp; v # elementwise AND (conjunction) ## [1] TRUE FALSE NA FALSE FALSE FALSE NA FALSE NA u | v # elementwise OR (disjunction) ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE NA TRUE NA NA !u # elementwise NOT (negation) ## [1] FALSE TRUE NA C.3.3 Comparison Operations We can compare the corresponding elements of two numeric vectors and get a logical vector in result. Operators such as &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), == (equal), != (not equal), &gt; (greater than) and &gt;= (greater than or equal) are again elementwise and use the recycling rule if necessary. 3 &lt; 1:5 # c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3) &lt; c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE 1:2 == 1:4 # c(1,2,1,2) == c(1,2,3,4) ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE z &lt;- c(0, 3, -1, 1, 0.5) (z &gt;= 0) &amp; (z &lt;= 1) ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE C.3.4 Aggregation Functions Also note the following operations on logical vectors: z &lt;- 1:10 all(z &gt;= 5) # are all values TRUE? ## [1] FALSE any(z &gt;= 5) # is there any value TRUE? ## [1] TRUE Moreover: sum(z &gt;= 5) # how many TRUE values are there? ## [1] 6 mean(z &gt;= 5) # what is the proportion of TRUE values? ## [1] 0.6 The behaviour of sum() and mean() is dictated by the fact that, when interpreted in numeric terms, TRUE is interpreted as numeric 1 and FALSE as 0. as.numeric(c(FALSE, TRUE)) ## [1] 0 1 Therefore in the example above we have: z &gt;= 5 ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE as.numeric(z &gt;= 5) ## [1] 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 sum(as.numeric(z &gt;= 5)) # the same as sum(z &gt;= 5) ## [1] 6 Yes, there are 6 values equal to TRUE (or 6 ones after conversion), the sum of zeros and ones gives the number of ones. C.4 Character Vectors C.4.1 Creating Character Vectors Individual character strings can be created using double quotes or apostrophes. These are the elements of character vectors (x &lt;- &quot;a string&quot;) ## [1] &quot;a string&quot; mode(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; class(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; length(x) ## [1] 1 rep(c(&quot;aaa&quot;, &#39;bb&#39;, &quot;c&quot;), 2) ## [1] &quot;aaa&quot; &quot;bb&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;aaa&quot; &quot;bb&quot; &quot;c&quot; C.4.2 Concatenating Character Vectors To join (concatenate) the corresponding elements of two or more character vectors, we call the paste() function: paste(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;a 1&quot; &quot;b 2&quot; &quot;c 3&quot; paste(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;), sep=&quot;&quot;) ## [1] &quot;a1&quot; &quot;b2&quot; &quot;c3&quot; Also note: paste(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), 1:3) # the same as as.character(1:3) ## [1] &quot;a 1&quot; &quot;b 2&quot; &quot;c 3&quot; paste(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), 1:6) # recycling ## [1] &quot;a 1&quot; &quot;b 2&quot; &quot;c 3&quot; &quot;a 4&quot; &quot;b 5&quot; &quot;c 6&quot; paste(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), 1:6, c(&quot;!&quot;, &quot;?&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;a 1 !&quot; &quot;b 2 ?&quot; &quot;c 3 !&quot; &quot;a 4 ?&quot; &quot;b 5 !&quot; &quot;c 6 ?&quot; C.4.3 Collapsing Character Vectors We can also collapse a sequence of strings to a single string: paste(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;), collapse=&quot;&quot;) ## [1] &quot;abcd&quot; paste(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;), collapse=&quot;,&quot;) ## [1] &quot;a,b,c,d&quot; C.5 Vector Subsetting C.5.1 Subsetting with Positive Indices In order to extract subsets (parts) of vectors, we use the square brackets: (x &lt;- seq(10, 100, 10)) ## [1] 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 x[1] # the first element ## [1] 10 x[length(x)] # the last element ## [1] 100 More than one element at a time can also be extracted: x[1:3] # the first three ## [1] 10 20 30 x[c(1, length(x))] # the first and the last ## [1] 10 100 For example, the order() function returns the indices of the smallest, 2nd smallest, 3rd smallest, …, the largest element in a given vector. We will use this function when implementing our first classifier. y &lt;- c(50, 30, 10, 20, 40) (o &lt;- order(y)) ## [1] 3 4 2 5 1 Hence, we see that the smallest element in y is at index 3 and the largest at index 1: y[o[1]] ## [1] 10 y[o[length(y)]] ## [1] 50 Therefore, to get a sorted version of y, we call: y[o] # see also sort(y) ## [1] 10 20 30 40 50 We can also obtain the 3 largest elements by calling: y[order(y, decreasing=TRUE)[1:3]] ## [1] 50 40 30 C.5.2 Subsetting with Negative Indices Subsetting with a vector of negative indices, excludes the elements at given positions: x[-1] # all but the first ## [1] 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 x[-(1:3)] ## [1] 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 x[-c(1:3, 5, 8)] ## [1] 40 60 70 90 100 C.5.3 Subsetting with Logical Vectors We may also subset a vector \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) of length \\(n\\) with a logical vector \\(\\boldsymbol{l}\\) also of length \\(n\\). The \\(i\\)-th element, \\(x_i\\), will be extracted if and only if the corresponding \\(l_i\\) is true. x[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)] ## [1] 10 50 70 80 100 This gets along nicely with comparison operators that yield logical vectors on output. x&gt;50 ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x[x&gt;50] # select elements in x that are greater than 50 ## [1] 60 70 80 90 100 x[x&lt;30 | x&gt;70] ## [1] 10 20 80 90 100 x[x&lt;max(x)] # getting rid of the greatest element ## [1] 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 x[x &gt; min(x) &amp; x &lt; max(x)] # return all but the smallest and greatest one ## [1] 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Of course, e.g., x[x&lt;max(x)] returns a new, independent object. In order to remove the greatest element in x permanently, we can write x &lt;- x[x&lt;max(x)]. C.5.4 Replacing Elements Note that the three above vector indexing schemes (positive, negative, logical indices) allow for replacing specific elements with new values. x[-1] &lt;- 10000 x ## [1] 10 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 x[-(1:7)] &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) x ## [1] 10 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 1 2 3 C.5.5 Other Functions head() and tail() return, respectively, a few (6 by default) first and last elements of a vector. head(x) # head(x, 6) ## [1] 10 10000 10000 10000 10000 10000 tail(x, 3) ## [1] 1 2 3 Sometimes the which() function can come in handy. For a given logical vector, it returns all the indices where TRUE elements are stored. which(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)) ## [1] 1 3 4 7 print(y) # recall ## [1] 50 30 10 20 40 which(y&gt;30) ## [1] 1 5 Note that y[y&gt;70] gives the same result as y[which(y&gt;70)] but is faster (because it involves less operations). which.min() and which.max() return the index of the smallest and the largest element, respectively: which.min(y) # where is the minimum? ## [1] 3 which.max(y) ## [1] 1 y[which.min(y)] # min(y) ## [1] 10 is.na() indicates which elements are missing values (NAs): z &lt;- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 6) is.na(z) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE Therefore, to remove them from z permanently, we can write (compare na.omit(), see also is.finite()): (z &lt;- z[!is.na(z)]) ## [1] 1 2 4 6 C.6 Named Vectors C.6.1 Creating Named Vectors Vectors in R can be named – each element can be assigned a string label. x &lt;- c(20, 40, 99, 30, 10) names(x) &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;) x # a named vector ## a b c d e ## 20 40 99 30 10 Other ways to create named vectors include: c(a=1, b=2, c=3) ## a b c ## 1 2 3 structure(1:3, names=c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)) ## a b c ## 1 2 3 For instance, the summary() function returns a named vector: summary(x) # NAMED vector, we don&#39;t want this here yet ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 10.0 20.0 30.0 39.8 40.0 99.0 This gives the minimum, 1st quartile (25%-quantile), Median (50%-quantile), aritmetic mean, 3rd quartile (75%-quantile) and maximum. Note that x is still a numeric vector, we can perform various operations on it as usual: sum(x) ## [1] 199 x[x&gt;3] ## a b c d e ## 20 40 99 30 10 Names can be dropped by calling: unname(x) ## [1] 20 40 99 30 10 as.numeric(x) # we need to know the type of x though ## [1] 20 40 99 30 10 C.6.2 Subsetting Named Vectors with Character String Indices It turns out that extracting elements from a named vector can also be performed by means of a vector of character string indices: x[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)] ## a d b ## 20 30 40 summary(x)[c(&quot;Median&quot;, &quot;Mean&quot;)] ## Median Mean ## 30.0 39.8 C.7 Factors Factors are special kinds of vectors that are frequently used to store qualitative data, e.g., species, groups, types. Factors are convenient in situations where we have many observations, but the number of distinct (unique) values is relatively small. Since R 4.0, the global option stringsAsFactors defaults to FALSE. Before that, functions such as data.frame() and read.csv() used to convert character vectors to factors automatically, which could lead to some unpleasant, hard to find bugs. Luckily, this is no longer the case. However, factor objects are still useful. C.7.1 Creating Factors For example, the following character vector: (col &lt;- sample(c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), replace=TRUE, 10)) ## [1] &quot;green&quot; &quot;green&quot; &quot;green&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;green&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; ## [9] &quot;green&quot; &quot;blue&quot; can be converted to a factor by calling: (fcol &lt;- factor(col)) ## [1] green green green red green red red red green blue ## Levels: blue green red Note how different is the way factors are printed out on the console. C.7.2 Levels We can easily obtain the list unique labels: levels(fcol) ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;green&quot; &quot;red&quot; Those can be re-encoded by calling: levels(fcol) &lt;- c(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) fcol ## [1] g g g r g r r r g b ## Levels: b g r To create a contingency table (in the form of a named numeric vector, giving how many values are at each factor level), we call: table(fcol) ## fcol ## b g r ## 1 5 4 C.7.3 Internal Representation (*) Factors have a look-and-feel of character vectors, however, internally they are represented as integer sequences. class(fcol) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; mode(fcol) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; as.numeric(fcol) ## [1] 2 2 2 3 2 3 3 3 2 1 These are always integers from 1 to M inclusive, where M is the number of levels. Their meaning is given by the levels() function: in the example above, the meaning of the codes 1, 2, 3 is, respectively, b, g, r. If we wished to generate a factor with a specific order of labels, we could call: factor(col, levels=c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)) ## [1] green green green red green red red red green blue ## Levels: red green blue We can also assign different labels upon creation of a factor: factor(col, levels=c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), labels=c(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)) ## [1] g g g r g r r r g b ## Levels: r g b Knowing how factors are represented is important when we deal with factors that are built around data that look like numeric. This is because their conversion to numeric gives the internal codes, not the actual values: (f &lt;- factor(c(1, 3, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 1, 4))) ## [1] 1 3 0 1 4 0 0 1 4 ## Levels: 0 1 3 4 as.numeric(f) # not necessarily what we want here ## [1] 2 3 1 2 4 1 1 2 4 as.numeric(as.character(f)) # much better ## [1] 1 3 0 1 4 0 0 1 4 Moreover, that idea is labour-saving in contexts such as plotting of data that are grouped into different classes. For instance, here is a scatter plot for the Sepal.Length and Petal.Width variables in the iris dataset (which is an object of type data.frame, see below). Flowers are of different Species, and we wish to indicate which point belongs to which class: which_preview &lt;- c(1, 11, 51, 69, 101) # indexes we show below iris$Sepal.Length[which_preview] ## [1] 5.1 5.4 7.0 6.2 6.3 iris$Petal.Width[which_preview] ## [1] 0.2 0.2 1.4 1.5 2.5 iris$Species[which_preview] ## [1] setosa setosa versicolor versicolor virginica ## Levels: setosa versicolor virginica as.numeric(iris$Species)[which_preview] ## [1] 1 1 2 2 3 plot(iris$Sepal.Length, # x (it&#39;s a vector) iris$Petal.Width, # y (it&#39;s a vector) col=as.numeric(iris$Species), # colours pch=as.numeric(iris$Species) ) Figure C.4: as.numeric() on factors can be used to create different plotting styles The above (see Figure C.4) was possible because the Species column is a factor object with: levels(iris$Species) ## [1] &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;versicolor&quot; &quot;virginica&quot; and the meaning of pch of 1, 2, 3, … is “circle”, “triangle”, “plus”, …, respectively. What’s more, there’s a default palette that maps consecutive integers to different colours: palette() ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;#DF536B&quot; &quot;#61D04F&quot; &quot;#2297E6&quot; &quot;#28E2E5&quot; &quot;#CD0BBC&quot; ## [7] &quot;#F5C710&quot; &quot;gray62&quot; Hence, black circles mark irises from the 1st class, i.e., “setosa”. C.8 Lists Numeric, logical and character vectors are atomic objects – each component is of the same type. Let’s take a look at what happens when we create an atomic vector out of objects of different types: c(&quot;nine&quot;, FALSE, 7, TRUE) ## [1] &quot;nine&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; c(FALSE, 7, TRUE, 7) ## [1] 0 7 1 7 In each case, we get an object of the most “general” type which is able to represent our data. On the other hand, R lists are generalised vectors. They can consist of arbitrary R objects, possibly of mixed types – also other lists. C.8.1 Creating Lists Most commonly, we create a generalised vector by calling the list() function. (l &lt;- list(1:5, letters, runif(3))) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; ## [18] &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 0.95683 0.45333 0.67757 mode(l) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; class(l) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; length(l) ## [1] 3 There’s a more compact way to print a list on the console: str(l) ## List of 3 ## $ : int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5 ## $ : chr [1:26] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; ... ## $ : num [1:3] 0.957 0.453 0.678 We can also convert an atomic vector to a list by calling: as.list(1:3) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3 C.8.2 Named Lists List, like other vectors, may be assigned a names attribute. names(l) &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) l ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## $b ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; ## [18] &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; ## ## $c ## [1] 0.95683 0.45333 0.67757 C.8.3 Subsetting and Extracting From Lists Applying a square brackets operator creates a sub-list, which is of type list as well. l[-1] ## $b ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;j&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;o&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;q&quot; ## [18] &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; ## ## $c ## [1] 0.95683 0.45333 0.67757 l[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)] ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## $c ## [1] 0.95683 0.45333 0.67757 l[1] ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 Note in the 3rd case we deal with a list of length one, not a numeric vector. To extract (dig into) a particular (single) element, we use double square brackets: l[[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 l[[&quot;c&quot;]] ## [1] 0.95683 0.45333 0.67757 The latter can equivalently be written as: l$c ## [1] 0.95683 0.45333 0.67757 C.8.4 Common Operations Lists, because of their generality (they can store any kind of object), have few dedicated operations. In particular, it neither makes sense to add, multiply, … two lists together nor to aggregate them. However, if we wish to run some operation on each element, we can call list-apply: (k &lt;- list(x=runif(5), y=runif(6), z=runif(3))) # a named list ## $x ## [1] 0.57263 0.10292 0.89982 0.24609 0.04206 ## ## $y ## [1] 0.32792 0.95450 0.88954 0.69280 0.64051 0.99427 ## ## $z ## [1] 0.65571 0.70853 0.54407 lapply(k, mean) ## $x ## [1] 0.37271 ## ## $y ## [1] 0.74992 ## ## $z ## [1] 0.6361 The above computes the mean of each of the three numeric vectors stored inside list k. Moreover: lapply(k, range) ## $x ## [1] 0.04206 0.89982 ## ## $y ## [1] 0.32792 0.99427 ## ## $z ## [1] 0.54407 0.70853 The built-in function range(x) returns c(min(x), max(x)). unlist() tries (it might not always be possible) to unwind a list to a simpler, atomic form: unlist(lapply(k, mean)) ## x y z ## 0.37271 0.74992 0.63610 Moreover, split(x, f) classifies elements in a vector x into subgroups defined by a factor (or an object coercible to) of the same length. x &lt;- c( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) f &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) split(x, f) ## $a ## [1] 1 3 4 8 9 ## ## $b ## [1] 2 6 7 10 ## ## $c ## [1] 5 This is very useful when combined with lapply() and unlist(). For instance, here are the mean sepal lengths for each of the three flower species in the famous iris dataset. unlist(lapply(split(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species), mean)) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 5.006 5.936 6.588 By the way, if we take a look at the documentation of ?lapply, we will note that that this function is defined as lapply(X, FUN, ...). Here ... denotes the optional arguments that will be passed to FUN. In other words, lapply(X, FUN, ...) returns a list Y of length length(X) such that Y[[i]] &lt;- FUN(X[[i]], ...) for each i. For example, mean() has an additional argument na.rm that aims to remove missing values from the input vector. Compare the following: t &lt;- list(1:10, c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)) unlist(lapply(t, mean)) ## [1] 5.5 NA unlist(lapply(t, mean, na.rm=TRUE)) ## [1] 5.5 3.0 Of course, we can always pass a custom (self-made) function object as well: min_mean_max &lt;- function(x) { # the last expression evaluated in the function&#39;s body # gives its return value: c(min(x), mean(x), max(x)) } lapply(k, min_mean_max) ## $x ## [1] 0.04206 0.37271 0.89982 ## ## $y ## [1] 0.32792 0.74992 0.99427 ## ## $z ## [1] 0.54407 0.63610 0.70853 or, more concisely (we can skip the curly braces here – they are normally used to group many expressions into one; also, if we don’t plan to re-use the function again, there’s no need to give it a name): lapply(k, function(x) c(min(x), mean(x), max(x))) ## $x ## [1] 0.04206 0.37271 0.89982 ## ## $y ## [1] 0.32792 0.74992 0.99427 ## ## $z ## [1] 0.54407 0.63610 0.70853 C.9 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (Venables et al. 2021) Other: (Deisenroth et al. 2020), (Peng 2019), (Wickham &amp; Grolemund 2017) References "],

I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. Vectors are one-dimensional objects – they represent “flat” sequences of values. Matrices, on the other hand, are two-dimensional – they represent tabular data, where values aligned into rows and columns. Matrices (and their extensions – data frames, which we’ll cover in the next chapter) are predominant in data science, where objects are typically represented by means of feature vectors. Below are some examples of structured datasets in matrix forms. head(as.matrix(iris[,1:4])) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## [1,] 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 ## [2,] 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 ## [3,] 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 ## [4,] 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 ## [5,] 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 ## [6,] 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 WorldPhones ## N.Amer Europe Asia S.Amer Oceania Africa Mid.Amer ## 1951 45939 21574 2876 1815 1646 89 555 ## 1956 60423 29990 4708 2568 2366 1411 733 ## 1957 64721 32510 5230 2695 2526 1546 773 ## 1958 68484 35218 6662 2845 2691 1663 836 ## 1959 71799 37598 6856 3000 2868 1769 911 ## 1960 76036 40341 8220 3145 3054 1905 1008 ## 1961 79831 43173 9053 3338 3224 2005 1076 The aim of this chapter is to cover the most essential matrix operations, both from the computational perspective and the mathematical one. D.1 Creating Matrices D.1.1 matrix() A matrix can be created – amongst others – with a call to the matrix() function. (A &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 class(A) ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;array&quot; Given a numeric vector of length 6, we’ve asked R to convert to a numeric matrix with 2 rows (the nrow argument). The number of columns has been deduced automatically (otherwise, we would additionally have to pass ncol=3 to the function). Using mathematical notation, above we have defined \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times 3}\\): \\[ \\mathbf{A}= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; a_{1,3} \\\\ a_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; a_{2,3} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] We can fetch the size of the matrix by calling: dim(A) # number of rows, number of columns ## [1] 2 3 We can also “promote” a “flat” vector to a column vector, i.e., a matrix with one column by calling: as.matrix(1:3) ## [,1] ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 D.1.2 Stacking Vectors Other ways to create a matrix involve stacking a couple of vectors of equal lengths along each other: rbind(1:3, 4:6, 7:9) # row bind ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 7 8 9 cbind(1:3, 4:6, 7:9) # column bind ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 These functions also allow for adding new rows/columns to existing matrices: rbind(A, c(-1, -2, -3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] -1 -2 -3 cbind(A, c(-1, -2)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 -1 ## [2,] 4 5 6 -2 D.1.3 Beyond Numeric Matrices Note that logical matrices are possible as well. For instance, knowing that comparison such as &lt; and == are performed elementwise also in the case of matrices, we can obtain: A &gt;= 3 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [2,] TRUE TRUE TRUE Moreover, although much more rarely used, we can define character matrices: matrix(LETTERS[1:12], ncol=6) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] &quot;A&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;K&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;J&quot; &quot;L&quot; D.1.4 Naming Rows and Columns Just like vectors could be equipped with names attribute: c(a=1, b=2, c=3) ## a b c ## 1 2 3 matrices can be assigned row and column labels in the form of a list of two character vectors: dimnames(A) &lt;- list( c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), # row labels c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) # column labels ) A ## x y z ## a 1 2 3 ## b 4 5 6 D.1.5 Other Methods The read.table() (and its special case, read.csv()), can be used to read a matrix from a text file. We will cover it in the next chapter, because technically it returns a data frame object (which we can convert to a matrix with a call to as.matrix()). outer() applies a given (vectorised) function on each pair of elements from two vectors, forming a two-dimensional “grid”. More precisely outer(x, y, f, ...) returns a matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) with length(x) rows and length(y) columns such that \\(z_{i,j}=f(x_i, y_j, ...)\\), where ... are optional further arguments to f. outer(c(1, 10, 100), 1:5, &quot;*&quot;) # apply the multiplication operator ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 5 ## [2,] 10 20 30 40 50 ## [3,] 100 200 300 400 500 outer(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 1:8, paste, sep=&quot;-&quot;) # concatenate strings ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ## [1,] &quot;A-1&quot; &quot;A-2&quot; &quot;A-3&quot; &quot;A-4&quot; &quot;A-5&quot; &quot;A-6&quot; &quot;A-7&quot; &quot;A-8&quot; ## [2,] &quot;B-1&quot; &quot;B-2&quot; &quot;B-3&quot; &quot;B-4&quot; &quot;B-5&quot; &quot;B-6&quot; &quot;B-7&quot; &quot;B-8&quot; simplify2array() is an extension of the unlist() function. Given a list of vectors, each of length one, it will return an “unlisted” vector. However, if a list of equisized vectors of greater lengths is given, these will be converted to a matrix. simplify2array(list(1, 11, 21)) ## [1] 1 11 21 simplify2array(list(1:3, 11:13, 21:23)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 11 21 ## [2,] 2 12 22 ## [3,] 3 13 23 simplify2array(list(1, 11:12, 21:23)) # no can do ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 11 12 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 21 22 23 sapply(...) is a nice application of the above, meaning simplify2array(lapply(...)). sapply(split(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species), mean) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 5.006 5.936 6.588 sapply(split(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species), summary) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## Min. 4.300 4.900 4.900 ## 1st Qu. 4.800 5.600 6.225 ## Median 5.000 5.900 6.500 ## Mean 5.006 5.936 6.588 ## 3rd Qu. 5.200 6.300 6.900 ## Max. 5.800 7.000 7.900 Of course, custom functions can also be applied: min_mean_max &lt;- function(x) { # returns a named vector with three elements # (note that the last expression in a function&#39;s body # is its return value) c(min=min(x), mean=mean(x), max=max(x)) } sapply(split(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species), min_mean_max) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## min 4.300 4.900 4.900 ## mean 5.006 5.936 6.588 ## max 5.800 7.000 7.900 Lastly, table(x, y) creates a contingency matrix that counts the number of unique pairs of corresponding elements from two vectors of equal lengths. library(&quot;titanic&quot;) # data on the passengers of the RMS Titanic table(titanic_train$Survived) ## ## 0 1 ## 549 342 table(titanic_train$Sex) ## ## female male ## 314 577 table(titanic_train$Survived, titanic_train$Sex) ## ## female male ## 0 81 468 ## 1 233 109 D.1.6 Internal Representation (*) Note that by setting byrow=TRUE in a call to the matrix() function above, we are reading the elements of the input vector in the row-wise (row-major) fashion. The default is the column-major order, which might be a little unintuitive for some of us. A &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE) B &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), ncol=3) # byrow=FALSE It turns out that is exactly the order in which the matrix is stored internally. Under the hood, it is an ordinary numeric vector: mode(B) # == mode(A) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; length(B) # == length(A) ## [1] 6 as.numeric(A) ## [1] 1 4 2 5 3 6 as.numeric(B) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 Also note that we can create a different view on the same underlying data vector: dim(A) &lt;- c(3, 2) # 3 rows, 2 columns A ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 5 ## [2,] 4 3 ## [3,] 2 6 dim(B) &lt;- c(3, 2) # 3 rows, 2 columns B ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 D.2 Common Operations D.2.1 Matrix Transpose The matrix transpose is denoted with \\(\\mathbf{A}^T\\): t(A) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 2 ## [2,] 5 3 6 Hence, \\(\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{A}^T\\) is a matrix such that \\(b_{i,j}=a_{j,i}\\). In other words, in the transposed matrix, rows become columns and columns become rows. For example: \\[ \\mathbf{A}= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} a_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; a_{1,3} \\\\ a_{2,1} &amp; a_{2,2} &amp; a_{2,3} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\qquad \\mathbf{A}^T= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} a_{1,1} &amp; a_{2,1} \\\\ a_{1,2} &amp; a_{2,2} \\\\ a_{1,3} &amp; a_{2,3} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] D.2.2 Matrix-Scalar Operations Operations such as \\(s\\mathbf{A}\\) (multiplication of a matrix by a scalar), \\(-\\mathbf{A}\\), \\(s+\\mathbf{A}\\) etc. are applied on each element of the input matrix: (A &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), byrow=TRUE, nrow=2)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 (-1)*A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -1 -2 -3 ## [2,] -4 -5 -6 In R, the same rule holds when we compute other operations (despite the fact that, mathematically, e.g., \\(\\mathbf{A}^2\\) or \\(\\mathbf{A}\\ge 0\\) might have a different meaning): A^2 # this is not A-matrix-multiply-A, see below ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 9 ## [2,] 16 25 36 A&gt;=3 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [2,] TRUE TRUE TRUE D.2.3 Matrix-Matrix Operations If \\(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) are two matrices of identical sizes, then \\(\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\) are understood elementwise, i.e., they result in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) such that \\(c_{i,j}=a_{i,j}\\pm b_{i,j}\\). A-A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 0 0 In R (but not when we use mathematical notation), all other arithmetic, logical and comparison operators are also applied in an elementwise fashion. A*A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 9 ## [2,] 16 25 36 (A&gt;2) &amp; (A&lt;=5) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] FALSE FALSE TRUE ## [2,] TRUE TRUE FALSE D.2.4 Matrix Multiplication (*) Mathematically, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\) denotes the matrix multiplication. It is a very different operation to the elementwise multiplication. (A &lt;- rbind(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 2 ## [2,] 3 4 (I &lt;- rbind(c(1, 0), c(0, 1))) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 0 ## [2,] 0 1 A %*% I # matrix multiplication ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 2 ## [2,] 3 4 This is not the same as the elementwise A*I. Matrix multiplication can only be performed on two matrices of compatible sizes – the number of columns in the left matrix must match the number of rows in the right operand. Given \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times m}\\), their multiply is a matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}\\) such that \\(c_{i,j}\\) is the dot product of the \\(i\\)-th row in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and the \\(j\\)-th column in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\): \\[ c_{i,j} = \\mathbf{a}_{i,\\cdot} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{\\cdot,j} = \\sum_{k=1}^p a_{i,k} b_{k, j} \\] for \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\) and \\(j=1,\\dots,m\\). Exercise. Multiply a few simple matrices of sizes \\(2\\times 2\\), \\(2\\times 3\\), \\(3\\times 2\\) etc. using pen and paper and checking the results in R. Also remember that, mathematically, squaring a matrix is done in terms of matrix multiplication, i.e., \\(\\mathbf{A}^2 = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}\\). It can only be performed on square matrices, i.e., ones with the same number of rows and columns. This is again different than R’s elementwise A^2. Note that \\(\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{A}\\) gives the matrix that consists of the dot products of all the pairs of columns in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). crossprod(A) # same as t(A) %*% A ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 10 14 ## [2,] 14 20 In one of the chapters on Regression, we note that the Pearson linear correlation coefficient can be beautifully expressed this way. D.2.5 Aggregation of Rows and Columns The apply() function may be used to transform or summarise individual rows or columns in a matrix. More precisely: apply(A, 1, f) applies a given function \\(f\\) on each row of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). apply(A, 2, f) applies a given function \\(f\\) on each column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). Usually, either \\(f\\) returns a single value (when we wish to aggregate all the elements in a row/column) or returns the same number of values (when we wish to transform a row/column). The latter case is covered in the next subsection. Let’s compute the mean of each row and column in A: (A &lt;- matrix(1:18, byrow=TRUE, nrow=3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## [2,] 7 8 9 10 11 12 ## [3,] 13 14 15 16 17 18 apply(A, 1, mean) # synonym: rowMeans(A) ## [1] 3.5 9.5 15.5 apply(A, 2, mean) # synonym: colMeans(A) ## [1] 7 8 9 10 11 12 We can also fetch the minimal and maximal value by means of the range() function: apply(A, 1, range) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 7 13 ## [2,] 6 12 18 apply(A, 2, range) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## [2,] 13 14 15 16 17 18 Of course, a custom function can be provided as well. Here we compute the minimum, average and maximum of each row: apply(A, 1, function(row) c(min(row), mean(row), max(row))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1.0 7.0 13.0 ## [2,] 3.5 9.5 15.5 ## [3,] 6.0 12.0 18.0 D.2.6 Vectorised Special Functions The special functions mentioned in the previous chapter, e.g., sqrt(), abs(), round(), log(), exp(), cos(), sin(), are also performed in an elementwise manner when applied on a matrix object. round(1/A, 2) # rounds every element in 1/A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1.00 0.50 0.33 0.25 0.20 0.17 ## [2,] 0.14 0.12 0.11 0.10 0.09 0.08 ## [3,] 0.08 0.07 0.07 0.06 0.06 0.06 An example plot of the absolute values of sine and cosine functions depicted using the matplot() function (see Figure D.1). x &lt;- seq(-2*pi, 6*pi, by=pi/100) Y &lt;- cbind(sin(x), cos(x)) # a matrix with two columns Y &lt;- abs(Y) # take the absolute value of every element in Y matplot(x, Y, type=&quot;l&quot;) Figure D.1: Example plot with matplot() D.2.7 Matrix-Vector Operations Mathematically, there is no generally agreed upon convention defining arithmetic operations between matrices and vectors. (*) The only exception is the matrix – vector multiplication in the case where an argument is a column or a row vector, i.e., in fact, a matrix. Hence, given \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) we may write \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\) only if \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{p\\times 1}\\) is a column vector. Similarly, \\(\\mathbf{y}\\mathbf{A}\\) makes only sense whenever \\(\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times n}\\) is a row vector. Remark. Please take notice of the fact that we consistently discriminate between different bold math fonts and letter cases: \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix, \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a row or column vector (still a matrix, but a sequence-like one) and \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\) is an ordinary vector (one-dimensional sequence). However, in R, we might sometimes wish to vectorise an arithmetic operation between a matrix and a vector in a row- or column-wise fashion. For example, if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) is a matrix and \\(\\mathbf{m}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times p}\\) is a row vector, we might want to subtract \\(m_i\\) from each element in the \\(i\\)-th column. Here, the apply() function comes in handy again. Example: to create a centred version of a given matrix, we need to subtract from each element the arithmetic mean of its column. (A &lt;- cbind(c(1, 2), c(2, 4), c(5, 8))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 5 ## [2,] 2 4 8 (m &lt;- apply(A, 2, mean)) # same as colMeans(A) ## [1] 1.5 3.0 6.5 t(apply(A, 1, function(r) r-m)) # note the transpose here ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.5 -1 -1.5 ## [2,] 0.5 1 1.5 The above is equivalent to: apply(A, 2, function(c) c-mean(c)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.5 -1 -1.5 ## [2,] 0.5 1 1.5 D.3 Matrix Subsetting Example matrices: (A &lt;- matrix(1:12, byrow=TRUE, nrow=3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 ## [2,] 5 6 7 8 ## [3,] 9 10 11 12 B &lt;- A dimnames(B) &lt;- list( c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), # row labels c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) # column labels ) B ## x y z w ## a 1 2 3 4 ## b 5 6 7 8 ## c 9 10 11 12 D.3.1 Selecting Individual Elements Matrices are two-dimensional structures: items are aligned in rows and columns. Hence, to extract an element from a matrix, we will need two indices. Mathematically, given a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), \\(a_{i,j}\\) stands for the element in the \\(i\\)-th row and the \\(j\\)-th column. The same in R: A[1, 2] # 1st row, 2nd columns ## [1] 2 B[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;y&quot;] # using dimnames == B[1,2] ## [1] 2 D.3.2 Selecting Rows and Columns We will sometimes use the following notation to emphasise that a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) consists of \\(n\\) rows or \\(p\\) columns: \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{a}_{1,\\cdot} \\\\ \\mathbf{a}_{2,\\cdot} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\mathbf{a}_{n,\\cdot} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,1} &amp; \\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{a}_{i,\\cdot}\\) is a row vector of length \\(p\\), i.e., a \\((1\\times p)\\)-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{a}_{i,\\cdot} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} a_{i,1} &amp; a_{i,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{i,p} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]. \\] Moreover, \\(\\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,j}\\) is a column vector of length \\(n\\), i.e., an \\((n\\times 1)\\)-matrix: \\[ \\mathbf{a}_{\\cdot,j} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} a_{1,j} &amp; a_{2,j} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{n,j} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]^T=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c} {a}_{1,j} \\\\ {a}_{2,j} \\\\ \\vdots\\\\ {a}_{n,j} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right], \\] We can extract individual rows and columns from a matrix by using the following notation: A[1,] # 1st row ## [1] 1 2 3 4 A[,2] # 2nd column ## [1] 2 6 10 B[&quot;a&quot;,] # of course, B[1,] is still legal ## x y z w ## 1 2 3 4 B[,&quot;y&quot;] ## a b c ## 2 6 10 Note that by extracting a single row/column, we get an atomic (one-dimensional) vector. However, we can preserve the dimensionality of the output object by passing drop=FALSE: A[ 1, , drop=FALSE] # 1st row ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 A[ , 2, drop=FALSE] # 2nd column ## [,1] ## [1,] 2 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 10 B[&quot;a&quot;, , drop=FALSE] ## x y z w ## a 1 2 3 4 B[ , &quot;y&quot;, drop=FALSE] ## y ## a 2 ## b 6 ## c 10 Now this is what we call proper row and column vectors! D.3.3 Selecting Submatrices To create a sub-block of a given matrix we pass two indexers, possibly of length greater than one: A[1:2, c(1, 2, 4)] # rows 1,2 columns 1,2,4 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 4 ## [2,] 5 6 8 B[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), c(1, 2, 4)] ## x y w ## a 1 2 4 ## b 5 6 8 A[c(1, 3), 3] ## [1] 3 11 A[c(1, 3), 3, drop=FALSE] ## [,1] ## [1,] 3 ## [2,] 11 D.3.4 Selecting Based on Logical Vectors and Matrices We can also subset a matrix with a logical matrix of the same size. This always yields a (flat) vector in return. A[A&gt;8] ## [1] 9 10 11 12 Logical vectors can also be used as indexers: A[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),] # select 1st and 3rd row ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 ## [2,] 9 10 11 12 A[,colMeans(A)&gt;6] # columns with means &gt; 6 ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 3 4 ## [2,] 7 8 ## [3,] 11 12 B[B[,&quot;x&quot;]&gt;1 &amp; B[,&quot;x&quot;]&lt;=9,] # All rows where x is in (1, 9] ## x y z w ## b 5 6 7 8 ## c 9 10 11 12 D.3.5 Selecting Based on Two-Column Matrices Lastly, note that we can also index a matrix A with a 2-column matrix I, i.e., A[I]. This allows for an easy access to A[I[1,1], I[1,2]], A[I[2,1], I[2,2]], A[I[3,1], I[3,2]], … I &lt;- cbind(c(1, 3, 2, 1, 2), c(2, 3, 2, 1, 4) ) A[I] ## [1] 2 11 6 1 8 This is exactly A[1, 2], A[3, 3], A[2, 2], A[1, 1], A[2, 4].

There will be not much work on-going in this repository anymore, as its sources have moved elsewhere; however, if you happen to find any bugs or typos, please drop me an email. I will share a new draft once it’s ripe. Stay tuned. R data.frames are similar to matrices in the sense that we use them to store tabular data.

In particular, read.csv() (see ?read.table for a long list of tunable parameters) imports data from plain text files organised in a tabular manner (such as comma-separated lists of values): f &lt;- tempfile() # temporary file name write.csv(x, f, row.names=FALSE) # save data frame to file cat(readLines(f), sep=&quot;\\n&quot;) # print file contents ## &quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;,&quot;w&quot; ## 0.181517061544582,TRUE,&quot;A&quot; ## 0.919722604798153,FALSE,&quot;B&quot; ## 0.31172346835956,FALSE,&quot;C&quot; ## 0.0641516039613634,TRUE,&quot;D&quot; ## 0.396421572659165,FALSE,&quot;E&quot; read.csv(f) ## u v w ## 1 0.181517 TRUE A ## 2 0.919723 FALSE B ## 3 0.311723 FALSE C ## 4 0.064152 TRUE D ## 5 0.396422 FALSE E Note that CSV is by far the most portable format for exchanging matrix-like objects between different programs (statistical or numeric computing environments, spreadsheets etc.). E.3 Data Frame Subsetting E.3.1 Each Data Frame is a List First of all, we should note that each data frame is in fact represented as an ordinary named list: class(x) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; Each column is stored as a separate list item. Having said that, we shouldn’t be surprised that we already know how to perform quite a few operations on data frames: length(x) # number of columns ## [1] 3 names(x) # column labels ## [1] &quot;u&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;w&quot; x$u # accessing column `u` (synonym: x[[&quot;u&quot;]]) ## [1] 0.181517 0.919723 0.311723 0.064152 0.396422 x[[2]] # 2nd column ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE x[c(1,3)] # a sub-data.frame ## u w ## 1 0.181517 A ## 2 0.919723 B ## 3 0.311723 C ## 4 0.064152 D ## 5 0.396422 E sapply(x, class) # apply class() on each column ## u v w ## &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;logical&quot; &quot;character&quot; E.3.2 Each Data Frame is Matrix-like Data frames can be considered as “generalised” matrices. Therefore, operations such as subsetting will work in the same manner. dim(x) # number of rows and columns ## [1] 5 3 x[1:2,] # first two rows ## u v w ## 1 0.18152 TRUE A ## 2 0.91972 FALSE B x[,c(1,3)] # 1st and 3rd column, synonym: x[c(1,3)] ## u w ## 1 0.181517 A ## 2 0.919723 B ## 3 0.311723 C ## 4 0.064152 D ## 5 0.396422 E x[,1] # synonym: x[[1]] ## [1] 0.181517 0.919723 0.311723 0.064152 0.396422 x[,1,drop=FALSE] # synonym: x[1] ## u ## 1 0.181517 ## 2 0.919723 ## 3 0.311723 ## 4 0.064152 ## 5 0.396422 Take a special note of selecting rows based on logical vectors. For instance, let’s extract all the rows from x where the values in the column named u are between 0.3 and 0.6: x[x$u&gt;=0.3 &amp; x$u&lt;=0.6, ] ## u v w ## 3 0.31172 FALSE C ## 5 0.39642 FALSE E x[!(x[,&quot;u&quot;]&lt;0.3 | x[,&quot;u&quot;]&gt;0.6), ] # equivalent ## u v w ## 3 0.31172 FALSE C ## 5 0.39642 FALSE E Moreover, subsetting based on integer vectors can be used to change the order of rows. Here is how we can sort the rows in x with respect to the values in column u: (x_sorted &lt;- x[order(x$u),]) ## u v w ## 4 0.064152 TRUE D ## 1 0.181517 TRUE A ## 3 0.311723 FALSE C ## 5 0.396422 FALSE E ## 2 0.919723 FALSE B Let’s stress that the programming style we emphasise on here is very transparent. If we don’t understand how a complex operation is being executed, we can always decompose it into smaller chunks that can be studied separately. For instance, as far as the last example is concerned, we can take a look at the manual of ?order and then inspect the result of calling order(x$u). On a side note, we can re-set the row names by referring to: row.names(x_sorted) &lt;- NULL x_sorted ## u v w ## 1 0.064152 TRUE D ## 2 0.181517 TRUE A ## 3 0.311723 FALSE C ## 4 0.396422 FALSE E ## 5 0.919723 FALSE B E.4 Common Operations We already know how to filter rows based on logical conditions, e.g.: iris[iris$Petal.Width &gt;= 1.2 &amp; iris$Petal.Width &lt;= 1.3, c(&quot;Petal.Width&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;)] ## Petal.Width Species ## 54 1.3 versicolor ## 56 1.3 versicolor ## 59 1.3 versicolor ## 65 1.3 versicolor ## 72 1.3 versicolor ## 74 1.2 versicolor ## 75 1.3 versicolor ## 83 1.2 versicolor ## 88 1.3 versicolor ## 89 1.3 versicolor ## 90 1.3 versicolor ## 91 1.2 versicolor ## 93 1.2 versicolor ## 95 1.3 versicolor ## 96 1.2 versicolor ## 97 1.3 versicolor ## 98 1.3 versicolor ## 100 1.3 versicolor iris[iris$Sepal.Length &gt; 6.5 &amp; iris$Species == &quot;versicolor&quot;, ] ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 51 7.0 3.2 4.7 1.4 versicolor ## 53 6.9 3.1 4.9 1.5 versicolor ## 59 6.6 2.9 4.6 1.3 versicolor ## 66 6.7 3.1 4.4 1.4 versicolor ## 76 6.6 3.0 4.4 1.4 versicolor ## 77 6.8 2.8 4.8 1.4 versicolor ## 78 6.7 3.0 5.0 1.7 versicolor ## 87 6.7 3.1 4.7 1.5 versicolor and aggregate information in individual columns: sapply(iris[1:4], summary) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## Min. 4.3000 2.0000 1.000 0.1000 ## 1st Qu. 5.1000 2.8000 1.600 0.3000 ## Median 5.8000 3.0000 4.350 1.3000 ## Mean 5.8433 3.0573 3.758 1.1993 ## 3rd Qu. 6.4000 3.3000 5.100 1.8000 ## Max. 7.9000 4.4000 6.900 2.5000 Quite frequently, we will be interested in summarising data within subgroups generated by a list of factor-like variables. aggregate(iris[1:4], iris[5], mean) ## Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## 1 setosa 5.006 3.428 1.462 0.246 ## 2 versicolor 5.936 2.770 4.260 1.326 ## 3 virginica 6.588 2.974 5.552 2.026 ToothGrowth[sample(nrow(ToothGrowth), 5), ] # 5 random rows ## len supp dose ## 12 16.5 VC 1.0 ## 10 7.0 VC 0.5 ## 17 13.6 VC 1.0 ## 50 27.3 OJ 1.0 ## 60 23.0 OJ 2.0 aggregate(ToothGrowth[&quot;len&quot;], ToothGrowth[c(&quot;supp&quot;, &quot;dose&quot;)], median) ## supp dose len ## 1 OJ 0.5 12.25 ## 2 VC 0.5 7.15 ## 3 OJ 1.0 23.45 ## 4 VC 1.0 16.50 ## 5 OJ 2.0 25.95 ## 6 VC 2.0 25.95 Taking into account that split() accepts a data frame input as well, we can perform what follows: sapply( # split iris into 3 sub-data.frames: split(iris, iris[5]), # on each sub-data.frame, apply the following function function(df) { # compute the mean of first four columns: sapply(df[1:4], mean) }) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## Sepal.Length 5.006 5.936 6.588 ## Sepal.Width 3.428 2.770 2.974 ## Petal.Length 1.462 4.260 5.552 ## Petal.Width 0.246 1.326 2.026 sapply(split(iris, iris[5]), function(df) { c(Sepal.Length=summary(iris$Sepal.Length), Petal.Length=summary(iris$Petal.Length) ) }) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## Sepal.Length.Min. 4.3000 4.3000 4.3000 ## Sepal.Length.1st Qu. 5.1000 5.1000 5.1000 ## Sepal.Length.Median 5.8000 5.8000 5.8000 ## Sepal.Length.Mean 5.8433 5.8433 5.8433 ## Sepal.Length.3rd Qu. 6.4000 6.4000 6.4000 ## Sepal.Length.Max. 7.9000 7.9000 7.9000 ## Petal.Length.Min. 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 ## Petal.Length.1st Qu. 1.6000 1.6000 1.6000 ## Petal.Length.Median 4.3500 4.3500 4.3500 ## Petal.Length.Mean 3.7580 3.7580 3.7580 ## Petal.Length.3rd Qu. 5.1000 5.1000 5.1000 ## Petal.Length.Max. 6.9000 6.9000 6.9000 The above syntax is not super-convenient, but it only uses the building blocks that we have already mastered! That should be very appealing to the minimalists. Note that R packages such as data.table and dplyr offer more convenient substitutes – you can always learn them on your own (which takes time, but it’s worth the hassle). They simplify the most common data wrangling tasks. Moreover, they have been optimised for speed – they can handle much larger data sets efficiently. E.5 Metaprogramming and Formulas (*) R (together with a few other programming languages such as Lisp and Scheme, that heavily inspired R’s semantics) allows its programmers to apply some metaprogramming techniques, that is, to write programs that manipulate unevaluated R expressions. For instance, take a close look at the following plot: z &lt;- seq(-2*pi, 2*pi, length.out=101) plot(z, sin(z), type=&quot;l&quot;) Figure E.1: Metaprogramming in action: Just take a look at the Y axis label How did the plot() function know that we are plotting sin of z (see Figure E.1)? It turns out that, at any time, we not only have access to the value of an object (such as the result of evaluating sin(z), which is a vector of 101 reals) but also to the expression that was passed as a function’s argument itself. test_meta &lt;- function(x) { cat(&quot;x equals to &quot;, x, &quot;\\n&quot;) # \\n == newline cat(&quot;x stemmed from &quot;, deparse(substitute(x)), &quot;\\n&quot;) } test_meta(2+7) ## x equals to 9 ## x stemmed from 2 + 7 This is very powerful and yet potentially very confusing to the users, because we can write functions that don’t compute the arguments provided in a way we expect them to (i.e., following the R language specification). Each function can constitute a new micro-verse, where with its own rules – we should always refer to the documentation. For instance, consider the subset() function: head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa subset(iris, Sepal.Length&gt;7.5, select=-(Sepal.Width:Petal.Width)) ## Sepal.Length Species ## 106 7.6 virginica ## 118 7.7 virginica ## 119 7.7 virginica ## 123 7.7 virginica ## 132 7.9 virginica ## 136 7.7 virginica Neither Sepal.Length&gt;6 nor -(Sepal.Width:Petal.Width) make sense as standalone R expressions! However, according to the subset() function’s own rules, the former expression is considered as a row selector (here, Sepal.Length refers to a particular column within the iris data frame). The latter plays the role of a column filter (select everything but all the columns between…). The data.table and dplyr packages (which are very popular) rely on this language feature all the time, so we shouldn’t be surprised when we see them. There is one more interesting language feature that is possible thanks to metaprogramming. Formulas are special R objects that consist of two unevaluated R expressions separated by a tilde (~). For example: len ~ supp+dose ## len ~ supp + dose A formula on its own has no meaning. However, many R functions accept formulas as arguments and can interpret them in various different ways. For example, the lm() function that fits a linear regression model, uses formulas to specify the output and input variables: lm(Sepal.Length~Petal.Length+Sepal.Width, data=iris) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length + Sepal.Width, data = iris) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) Petal.Length Sepal.Width ## 2.249 0.472 0.596 On the other hand, boxplot() (see Figure E.2) allows for creating separate box-and-whisker plots for each subgroup given by a combination of factors. boxplot(len~supp+dose, data=ToothGrowth, horizontal=TRUE, col=&quot;white&quot;) Figure E.2: Example box plot created via the formula interface The aggregate() function supports formulas too: aggregate(cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)~Species, data=iris, mean) ## Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## 1 setosa 5.006 3.428 ## 2 versicolor 5.936 2.770 ## 3 virginica 6.588 2.974 We should therefore make sure that we know how every function interacts with a formula – information on that can be found in ?lm, ?boxplot, ?aggregate and so forth. E.6 Further Reading Recommended further reading: (Venables et al. 2021) Other: (Peng 2019), (Wickham &amp; Grolemund 2017) R packages dplyr and data.table implement the most common data frame wrangling procedures. You may find them very useful. Moreover, they are very fast even for large data sets. Additionally, the magrittr package provides a pipe operator, %&gt;%, that simplifies the writing of complex, nested function calls. Do note that not everyone is a big fan of these, however.
