Code of Conduct
===============

This is a project conveyed in the author's free time. It's his little
act of charity to make this world an (even) better place.
It'll most likely pass unnoticed, but if you happen to find it useful,
informative, amusing, or stimulating, I'm happy for you.

Please be civilised, well-mannered, and courteous. Primum non nocere.
Let's all strive to be better versions of ourselves, exercise forgiveness
and generosity, and assume good faith in others.

Please reflect on the above before contacting me. Moreover, read this book's
introductory part for an overview of the philosophy it implements;
maybe it already addresses your concerns. I am generally quite busy and
might not have time to reply to queries whose have been clarified here
or in other easily accessible references; seeking answers on your own
will help you become more independent, this is how we all learn, after all.

Most likely, if I wrote X, came up with an assumption Y, or made a design
choice Z, there has been a strong reason for it. Try to find it.

Any bug/typos fixes are appreciated, as well as interesting and non-trivial
remarks that could lead to the improvement of the presented material
or my learning something new. Please email me about any issues discovered;
my contact data can be found at my [homepage][1]. Thank you.
