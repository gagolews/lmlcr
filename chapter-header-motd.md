> This is a slightly older (distributed in the hope that it will be useful)
version of the forthcoming textbook (ETA 2022) preliminarily entitled
*Machine Learning in R from Scratch* by
[Marek Gagolewski](https://www.gagolewski.com), which is now undergoing
a major revision (when I am not busy with other projects). There will be
not much work on-going in this repository anymore, as its sources have
moved elsewhere; however, if you happen to find any bugs or typos,
please drop me an
[email](https://github.com/gagolews/lmlcr/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
I will share a new draft once it is ripe. Stay tuned.
